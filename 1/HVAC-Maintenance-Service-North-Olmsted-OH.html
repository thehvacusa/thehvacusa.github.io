Modern 2- and three-stage furnaces increase effectiveness even further by performing at lower or greater capability depending upon the heating requirements of the location.<p>

Next, turn off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then pull the disconnect block (Image 1) and clean the condenser coils (Image 2).
