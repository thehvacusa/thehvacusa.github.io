I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>

<p>There are a couple of possibilities to discuss short biking in very cold weather. The most obvious is the possibility of the high demands put on the system due to the very low temperature levels.

<p>Allergens are products that trigger an immune-type reaction in people who are sensitized to these products. Irritants discovered in indoor air are mostly biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, germs, and mold. All of these materials are small particles, can become airborne, and therefore, are quickly breathed in. Irritants that are inhaled by sensitized individuals with asthma can trigger asthma attacks. For example, if you think of a group of individuals with asthma, the existence of feline irritant could induce an asthma attack in people with feline allergic reactions, but not in those individuals who do not have cat allergic reactions.<p>
<p>The predominant health result associated with exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might posture dangers, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your danger of lung cancer is especially high.<p>
