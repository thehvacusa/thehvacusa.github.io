During the 1970s, lots of property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation step. Nevertheless, many of these houses were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation.
