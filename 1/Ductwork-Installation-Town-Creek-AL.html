<p>Due to the present Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The ability to cool and heat your house at optimal effectiveness will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is presently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot home will require a much bigger AC unit than a smaller house, which will impact installation expenses. Also a house with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no fractures for air flow will require far less AC capability to keep temperatures comfortable. Other aspects that can impact this might be the insulation elsewhere such as the structure, roofing, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
