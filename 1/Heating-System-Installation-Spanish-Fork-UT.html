<p>Moisture management and humidity control requires running HVAC systems as created. Wetness management and humidity control might conflict with efforts to attempt to enhance the operation to save energy. For instance, moisture management and humidity control needs systems to be set to provide makeup air at lower temperature levels (style levels), rather of the greater temperature levels in some cases used to save energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions. However, for most of the United States and many parts of Europe and Japan, during most of hours of the year, outdoor air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not need further cooling to provide thermal convenience inside your home. Nevertheless, high humidity outdoors creates the need for careful attention to humidity levels inside your home. High humidities trigger mold growth and moisture inside your home is associated with a higher prevalence of resident breathing problems.<p>
