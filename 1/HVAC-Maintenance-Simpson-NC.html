<h3>Understanding the Basics of Furnace, AC and HVAC Maintenance at Simpson NC</h3>
<p>Ventilating or ventilation (the "V" in HVAC) is the process of exchanging or replacing air in any space to offer high indoor air quality which involves temperature level control, oxygen replenishment, and removal of moisture, odors, smoke, heat, dust, airborne germs, co2, and other gases. Ventilation eliminates undesirable smells and extreme moisture, introduces outdoors air, keeps interior building air circulating, and prevents stagnancy of the interior air.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical mix utilized in automobiles in the U.S. up until 1994, when most designs altered to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting capacity of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer produced in the U.S. for this type of application, but is still imported and can be purchased and used by certified HVAC service technicians. For systems needing only an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in great working order and performing far better than essentially all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "low-cost" by numerous people.<p>
