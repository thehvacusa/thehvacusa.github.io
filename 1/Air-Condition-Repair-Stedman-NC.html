<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. The selection of indoor systems has one limitation: their overall power must not exceed the capability of the outside unit. In practice, however, it is very typical to see a multi-split system with an overall capacity of indoor systems higher than the outside capacity by a minimum of 20%. However, it is wrong to expect much better efficiency when all indoor systems are turned on at the exact same time, considering that the total capacity of the entire system is restricted by the capacity of the outside unit. Basically, the outside unit will disperse all its power to all running indoor systems in such a method that some of the rooms may not have a very comfortable temperature level. However, the calculation of the total power is not simple, considering that it takes into consideration not only the nominal power of the systems, but likewise the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the vehicle debit, although my company does not provide car debit numerous companies do so they can have a known quantity of money being available in each month, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do decide to offer car debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There must not be any reason why your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>
