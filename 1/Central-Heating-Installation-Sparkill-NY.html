<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the auto debit, although my company does not offer automobile debit many companies do so they can have a recognized amount of cash coming in monthly, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do decide to offer car debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There should not be any reason why your company can not use this. Hope this assists.<p>

<h3>How to Limit the Prices of Air Conditioner Repair in Sparkill NY</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government company, performed a research study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy expenses by enhancing air flow. After checking 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy effectiveness. Sometimes, determined particle levels in fact increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is normally an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without airflow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
