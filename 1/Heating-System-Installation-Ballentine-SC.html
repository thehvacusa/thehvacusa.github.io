<p>WE ARE ALSO PROVIDING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline in between the water pipe going into and the pipes leaving the conventional water heater. Set up a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional water heater are open, water will flow from the solar storage tank to the traditional hot water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the water pipe going into and the pipes leaving the traditional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar tank past the conventional hot water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer season when water temperature levels are high, and the conventional water heater can be shut down entirely.<p>
