<h2>How To Hire Emergency HVAC Contractor in Mapleton</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. Either it was undercharged at installation or it leakages if your air conditioner is low on refrigerant. If it leaks, merely including refrigerant is not a service. A skilled technician should repair any leak, test the repair, and then charge the system with the right amount of refrigerant. Bear in mind that the performance and performance of your air conditioning system is biggest when the refrigerant charge exactly matches the manufacturer's requirements, and is neither undercharged nor overcharged. Refrigerant leakages can also be harmful to the environment.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding task finding the outdoor system as close to your home as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my lawn and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was really experienced of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
