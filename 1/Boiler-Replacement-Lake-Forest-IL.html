If numerous registers were closed or the filter was obstructed, the reduced air flow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. If you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or up until there's excellent air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it.
