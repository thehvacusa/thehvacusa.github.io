<h3>Furnace Maintenance  in Burlington KY</h3>
<p>There is a transformer in your cooling furnace. The transformer is what materials 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. Your Nest will not come on if your transformer breakdowns. Your transformer transforms the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency safety switches that protect your a/c system from flooding. One of the most common areas for emergency ac repair midtown Tx security switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is an excellent chance; you may have a water leakage in the attic if your Nest is revealing a blank screen. The water triggers your emergency safety switch, therefore cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This deactivates all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is also a baseplate that connects to the Nest. We have seen baseplate go bad on uncommon celebrations.<p>
