After checking 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no considerable enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy performance.

In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
