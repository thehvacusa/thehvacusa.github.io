<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
