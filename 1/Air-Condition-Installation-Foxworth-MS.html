We understand about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air contaminants are often 2 to 5 times higher than outside levels, and sometimes these levels can surpass 100 times that of outdoor levels of the exact same toxins.

An example of time control is scheduling floor stripping and waxing (with the ventilation system functioning) on a Friday.

Place control includes moving the contaminant source far from residents or perhaps moving prone residents.<p>
