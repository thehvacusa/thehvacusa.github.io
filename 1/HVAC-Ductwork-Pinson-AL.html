Buildings continuously develop as a result of the changes in the environment around them along with the residents, products, and activities within them. The numerous surfaces and the air inside a building are constantly communicating, and this interaction leads to changes in each. For example, we may see a window as changing a little gradually as it becomes filthy, then is cleaned, collects dirt once again, is cleaned up once again, and so on through its life.

A structure walk-through to check for smells and try to find water damage, leaks, dirt or insect droppings might be useful. Leakages require to be eliminated. Standing water in humidifiers, a/c units, on roofings and in boiler pans can end up being infected with fungi or germs and require to be eliminated, also.
