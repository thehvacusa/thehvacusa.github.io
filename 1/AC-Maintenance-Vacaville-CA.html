<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the two specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
