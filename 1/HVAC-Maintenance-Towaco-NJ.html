<p>How climate change affects air quality and direct exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a standard modus operandi for contemporary air conditioning unit) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the a/c unit increase. This increase has the effect that, for each system of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning unit gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning system need to increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is triggered, and the air conditioning unit has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioning unit's power intake will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, thus making the 100 W heating aspect cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
