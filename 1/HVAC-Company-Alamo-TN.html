<h3>The Operation of the Boiler Burner in Alamo TN</h3>
<p>Another technique to lowering the concentrations of indoor air pollutants in your home is to increase the amount of outdoor air coming inside. The majority of house heating and cooling systems, consisting of required air heating systems, do not mechanically bring fresh air into the house. Opening doors and windows, running window or attic fans, when the weather condition permits, or running a window air conditioning system with the vent control open increases the outdoor ventilation rate. Local restroom or kitchen fans that exhaust outdoors eliminate contaminants directly from the room where the fan lies and likewise increase the outside air ventilation rate.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the need to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
