<p>Measurement procedures are being established and shown to assess structure ventilation and indoor toxin concentrations. These procedures vary from advanced tracer gas techniques utilized predominantly in developing research efforts to less involved procedures that can be utilized by building operators.

<p>. Prior to picking the installation location of air conditioning unit, several primary elements require to be thought about. Firstly, the direction of air flow from the indoor units ought to not fall on the location of rest or work area. Second of all, there should not be any barriers en route of the airflow that might prevent it from covering the space of the facilities as much as possible. The outdoor system must also be found in an open space, otherwise the heat from the house will not be effectively discharged outside and the performance of the entire system will drop greatly.
