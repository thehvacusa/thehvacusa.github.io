<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, indicating they use air to exchange heat, in the exact same method as a cars and truck radiator or common family ac system does. Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It gathers water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which should be vented outside the cooled location; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled location to the outside air.<p>

<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil change' kind of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'might' trigger a problem in the future. So he said I could swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
