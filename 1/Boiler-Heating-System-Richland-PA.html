<p>Your full-service HVAC Repair and Installation Company. Even with routine preventive maintenance, though, there will always be the odd problem that periodically shows up.

<p>A clogged up furnace filter can cause a furnace to turn off. Dirty filters are the most common reason for furnace problems.

Change the filter if the blower is running however no heat is coming out. A dirty filter also causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, decreasing the performance of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
