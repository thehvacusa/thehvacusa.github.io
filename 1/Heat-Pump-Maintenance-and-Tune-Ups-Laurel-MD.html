Purchased a brand-new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever buy extended warranties or service arrangements on anything however HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Excellent investment in my viewpoint. Never ever attempt to sell me something I don't need.<p>
