<h3>Commercial HVAC in Vermillion MN</h3>
<p>I have been using them for years for my services, my own houses and my property customers' homes. I went through 5 other companies prior to I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies quoted me with different rates and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who explained to me completely the issues which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental house, another occasion. When I called and he encouraged me to call service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the system working again, he helped me problem shoot the concern. He is honest, dependable, and reasonable on price. It's tough to discover a sincere AC guy and I'm glad I found Luis. Extremely recommend Luis and his company.<p>
<p>EER means Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy performance of central air units is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set variety of conditions. As discussed above, a BTU is a traditional unit of heat; it is specified as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The typical set conditions are outside temperatures of 95 Â° F and an indoor temperature of 80 Â° F with 50% humidity, which is why the majority of people do not use this measurement much anymore.<p>
<p>I am really amazed with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call company several years earlier and know the value of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also impressed that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be utilizing Waycoff's again, and would recommend them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
<p>Have utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They give me top priority and a lower rate when I have concerns. Purchased a new primary unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever buy prolonged guarantees or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Excellent financial investment in my opinion. Never try to offer me something I don't require.<p>
