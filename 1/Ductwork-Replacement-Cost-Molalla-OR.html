<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps become ineffective in more extreme cold.

Some heatpump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
