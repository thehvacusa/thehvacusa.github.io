<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to evaporate, thus the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it takes in heat from the inside air, go back to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. While doing so, heat is taken in from inside your home and transferred outdoors, resulting in cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working during times of high humidity, when there is very little dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for house occupants. Unlike other kinds of ac system, evaporative coolers count on the outdoors air to be directed through cooler pads that cool the air prior to it reaches the inside of a home through its duct system; this cooled outside air should be allowed to press the warmer air within the house out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically easy to preserve and understand.<p>
