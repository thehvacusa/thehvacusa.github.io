And, if you have actually registered for an energy-saving device from your local power utility, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you have actually installed the parts revealed and reinstalled the disconnect block, repowered the breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and decreased the temperature level below the indoor temperature level, and the system does not fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
