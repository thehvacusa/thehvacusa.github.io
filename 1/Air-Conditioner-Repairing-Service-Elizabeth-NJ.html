<p>Keep in mind that the SEER score is computed utilizing the exact same set of temperature levels across the board. The typical summertime temperature level to arrive at the SEER score is 83 degrees, so to get to the right SEER rating for your location, subtract 2 points for every 10 degrees over 83. The minimum SEER rating has to be at least 13 for all new cooling systems manufactured in the United States.<p>
<p>It might feel cozy being sealed in tight versus the cold in your house during the chillier months of the year, but for individuals who are delicate to indoor irritants or have breathing problems, winter can worsen issues. Stale indoor air and heater can increase the amount of allergy-inducing allergen, animal dander, and mold spores flowing through your home. In late winter and early spring, it may still be too cold to throw open the windows to pull out the moldy air, so while you wait for the warmer weather condition it is very important to be knowledgeable about some of the allergy and respiratory triggers that might be lurking in your surroundings.<p>
<p>Lastly, if you do identify a particularly energy-efficient in-floor heater and choose to install it in your house, you might be qualified for state or federal programs that can help cover your up-front contractor expenses. (And these costs can be substantial.
