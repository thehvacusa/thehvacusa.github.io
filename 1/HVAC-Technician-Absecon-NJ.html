Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet.

However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to wear and tear and is easily punctured.<p>

I appreciate the sincerity. Stability isn't just their name, it's a company design they take seriously. You people are formally on speed dial. Talk to you quickly.<p>
