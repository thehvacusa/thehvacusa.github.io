<h3>HVAC Repair Warnings You Should Not Ignore in Benson NC</h3>
<p>You are a covidiot if you need furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating. Our furnace went down with a damaged igniter, and no one else could come except for SW. They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, but they had to buy it. My better half said that she had actually seen a terrific evaluation for James, so I called. He came in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and discussed the circumstance to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He provided to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the nicest, most decent people I have actually fulfilled in a long period of time. If we want to have options to ACME heating, we require to support the genuine people who are there for us. Please do.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and well-informed. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
