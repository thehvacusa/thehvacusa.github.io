<h3>Residential Heat Pumps in Birmingham AL</h3>
<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (most of the times) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is already GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad need to be GFCI secured.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and problem breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we chose to set up a dedicated circuit with its own wiring and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are available.<p>
