<p>Inspect these three things first if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make certain all the registers in your house are large open. Then make certain the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If numerous registers were closed or the filter was clogged, the decreased air flow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. Deice the A-coil if you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or till there's good airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually solved the problem.<p>
