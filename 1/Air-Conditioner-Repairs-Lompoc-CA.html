The unit runs silently and efficiently, but to have 2 significant components stop working in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (defrost control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were listed on the billing prior to work began.
