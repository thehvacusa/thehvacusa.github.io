<p>Indoor pollutants. These include chemicals utilized in the building and construction or restoration of buildings (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning compounds). In addition, devices that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide Insufficient combustion and bad ventilation of these appliances (cook stoves, gas heating systems, gas boilers, and gas hot water heater) can contribute to indoor pollutants.
