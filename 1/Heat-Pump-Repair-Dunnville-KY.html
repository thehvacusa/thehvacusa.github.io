<p>Air pollutants can vary from pollutants brought in from the outdoors by your animals to harmful gas leakages. Carbon monoxide is a typical air toxin resulting from gas that gets away into your home without being burnt. Older houses may include asbestos and lead particles, which can be damaging to the lungs when launched into the air. In kitchens and bathrooms, mold and mildew can become an annoyance where wetness levels are normally greater than in the rest of your home.<p>
<p>As soon as the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high enough temperature, a blower fan will start to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger enables air to be warmed without being available in contact with the real flame or burner location. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the house's duct, supplying warm air to individual bed rooms, living spaces and kitchens through the vents or registers.<p>
