<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, but furnace technicians frequently discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Look for a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be completely depressed for the furnace to run.<p>

Children might have higher direct exposures because they are most likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated objects into their mouths.<p>

<p>I am very satisfied with this company. One of my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call business many years back and know the significance of having the right parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm likewise satisfied that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be utilizing Waycoff's again, and would recommend them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
