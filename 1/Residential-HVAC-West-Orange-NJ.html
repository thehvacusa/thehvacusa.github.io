<h3>Understanding the Basics of Furnace, AC and HVAC Maintenance in West Orange NJ</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government agency, performed a study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy costs by enhancing air flow. After testing 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no significant enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy performance. In many cases, measured particle levels actually increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
