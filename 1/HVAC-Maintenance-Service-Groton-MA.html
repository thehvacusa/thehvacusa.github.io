<p>How environment modification impacts air quality and exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature (which is a basic modus operandi for contemporary ac system) requires that the rate of energy removal by the ac system increase. This increase has the impact that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioner eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c need to increase its power intake by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of efficiency) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is triggered, and the air conditioning unit has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The ac system's power intake will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, thus making the 100 W heating element cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
