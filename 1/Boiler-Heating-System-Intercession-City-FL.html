<h3>HVAC Duct Cleaning in Your Intercession City FL Home</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was fantastic and on time. Josh was extremely clear and quick about his assessment, ensuring I comprehended what was watched out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So possibly a little steep on price for this service, but the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is usually an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
