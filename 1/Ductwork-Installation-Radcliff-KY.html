<p>Cooling can also be supplied by a process called totally free cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is added because the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, thus decreasing its efficiency.<p>
<p>The primary reason house owners do not acquire an HVAC service contract is the cost. They can cost between $150 and $500 each year, depending on the amount of services offered.

<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is brought on by a waterborne germs Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary route of direct exposure is through the production of an aerosol result, the majority of frequently from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial structures is from inadequately put or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which often launch water in an aerosol which might get in close-by ventilation intakes. Break outs in medical centers and assisted living home, where patients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most typically reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has actually involved outside fountains in public attractions. The existence of Legionella in commercial building water products is extremely under-reported, as healthy people need heavy direct exposure to obtain infection.<p>
