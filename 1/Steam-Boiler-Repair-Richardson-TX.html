The heat exchanger allows air to be heated without coming in contact with the actual flame or burner location. Once it reaches an adequate temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the home's duct, supplying warm air to individual bedrooms, living rooms and kitchens through the vents or registers.<p>
