<p>Instead of incorporating to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head system that installs on a wall. Because approximately 20% of the heat produced by a central HVAC unit may be lost to leaks in your ducts, a ductless unit has an integrated efficiency advantage. Due to the fact that they do not need any brand-new ductwork to be installed, ductless heat pumps are great for additions. Because an unit is installed in each space or location you wish to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensing units that automatically raise the temperature in the space when you are present.<p>

<p>New air conditioning system generally range from 13 SEER to 23 SEER. A greater SEER rating suggests greater energy effectiveness and potentially lower energy costs.
