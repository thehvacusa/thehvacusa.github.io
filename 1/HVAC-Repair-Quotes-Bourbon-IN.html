<p>Details offered in this safety guide is based on current scientific and technical understanding of the issues presented and is reflective of the jurisdictional borders developed by the statutes governing the co-authoring companies. The standards do not need you to alter your existing central air systems, and replacement parts and services must still be offered for your home's systems. The "lifespan" of a central air conditioning conditioner has to do with 15 to 20 years. Makers generally continue to support existing equipment by making replacement parts readily available and honoring maintenance agreements after the brand-new standard goes into impact.<p>
<p>An AC system maintenance cost can be $50 to $110 for a single see, or you can sign up for a maintenance plan with your local heating and a/c company. That will cost about $150 to $300 a year.

Some companies provide concern consultations to their maintenance plan members.<p>

<p>If you presume a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of visible development or a moldy smell consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold begins with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and keep. Leaky return ducts can likewise introduce wetness. Once again, if you think a mold issue, think about having a service company examine the duct system for leakages.<p>
