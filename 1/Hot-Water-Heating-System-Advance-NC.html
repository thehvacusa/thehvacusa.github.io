<p>AC air handler screeching or grinding sounds. Though most air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older systems might be belt-driven. When the belt that connects the motor to the blower slips, screeching noises from a belt-drive air handler typically happen.

<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
