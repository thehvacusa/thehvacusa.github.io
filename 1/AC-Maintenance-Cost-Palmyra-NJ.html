Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to ensure they were no problems aside from the blower motor. The only reason he could not install the brand-new blower motor was since there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the problem is.<p>
