<p>While these steps will assist to keep your AC system in leading shape, be aware that there are maintenance items that only an experienced HVAC technician will be able to do. For instance, a sluggish refrigerant leak in your AC system can result in expensive compressor failure, however a house owner does not have the tools or abilities needed to check refrigerant levels. Also, tidy ducts and proper airflow are essential to a well-functioning system, however homeowners do not have the essential equipment for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart house owner, it's still necessary to have a professional technician check the system occasionally.<p>
<p>Indoor temperatures are often more tough to control than they appear due to factors such as heat gains from sunshine, outside conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperatures ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity needs to be maintained at or listed below 65%. The EPA advises humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to reduce mold development.<p>
<p>No matter the kind of electric glowing flooring heater, all are factory-built to remain in one piece and not cut, broken or changed. Any interference or disruption in the flow of electricity makes the system unusable. This is one of the drawbacks to installing an electric convected heat system. However, assuming they are installed properly and correctly looked after, the possibility of them having problems is little.<p>
