<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
