<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Heating is the biggest energy cost in the typical home. In very dry environments, evaporative coolers, often described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature of the incoming air is decreased, but it is likewise more damp, so the overall heat (practical heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. A few of the sensible heat of the going into air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the results can be quite significant.<p>
<p>A ducted heat pump looks like a large central air conditioner unit that sits outside your house. Heat pumps run on electricity and work like air conditioning system in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outside air.

They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>
