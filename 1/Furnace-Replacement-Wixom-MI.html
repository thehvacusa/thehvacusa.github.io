<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional task locating the outside system as close to your home as possible per my request. The task took two days and my yard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely well-informed of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
