<p>We recommend using our insulation boards when setting up over concrete slabs. When used in combination with underfloor heating by acting as a very effective thermal barrier, Warmup Insulation Boards will conserve you cash. They shows the heat upwards into the flooring tile instead of allowing heat to heat up the concrete slab listed below.

Without insulation boards it could take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
