<p>Details supplied in this safety guide is based on existing clinical and technical understanding of the problems presented and is reflective of the jurisdictional limits developed by the statutes governing the co-authoring agencies. The standards do not need you to change your existing central air units, and replacement parts and services ought to still be offered for your home's systems.

As a preventative measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, typically installed on the side of the furnace.<p>
