<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding task locating the outside unit as close to your house as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my yard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work.

He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>Sean was very valuable. He is a really pleasant person to deal with. No pressure applied to buy extra things. Answered all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to ensure they were no problems other than the blower motor. Since there was not one on hand, the only reason he could not set up the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the issue is.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Simply today I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the very same day. He understood simply what the problem was and repaired it extremely quickly. However here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my whole air conditioning and gas heat went totally dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
