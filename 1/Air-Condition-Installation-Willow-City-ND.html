<p>WE ARE ALSO PROVIDING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe in between the water pipe getting in and the water pipe leaving the conventional hot water heater. Install a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional hot water heater are open, water will stream from the solar tank to the conventional water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the pipes going into and the pipes leaving the conventional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar tank past the standard water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer season when water temperature levels are high, and the conventional water heater can be shut off totally.<p>
