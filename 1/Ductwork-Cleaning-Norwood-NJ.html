<h3>HVAC Repair Quotes in Norwood NJ</h3>
<p>Some cooling systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heatpump, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently described as "reverse cycle air conditioning unit".

The outside condenser system likewise changes functions to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outside air).<p>
