<p>Due to the fact that it has to run longer than a properly sized unit, an undersize system won't be able to cool spaces down entirely on the hottest days and will cost more to operate. A large-scale compressor also costs more to run since it merely takes more electricity to run a bigger system. And an oversize system doesn't lower humidity effectively. That's since it cools the air so quickly that it shuts down before it has an opportunity to circulate the proper volume of air past the coils to draw out the needed moisture. The outcome is a space that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature shows. In reality, the room can feel clammy and damp.<p>

<p>When the heatpump went out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was extremely helpful in collecting information on the phone and offering clear guidelines about how to momentarily manage the issue and prepare the heat pump for efficient repair the next day.

The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started.
