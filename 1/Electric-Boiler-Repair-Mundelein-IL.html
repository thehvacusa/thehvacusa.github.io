<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has actually been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Current research studies indicate that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned goods are stored and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save money by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical during the pushing and ending up procedures. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to decrease your exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them until they have been correctly dried if dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical odor when you choose them up.

<p>As a number of you discussed, preventative maintenance is required by all major equipment manufacturer's to guarantee your factory guarantees remain in place. In addition, the tangible results of a PM is frequently hard to measure, as one reaction stated the savings in efficiency or repairs that were prevented. Many pieces of a furnace or a/c do not just break at the snap of a finger, but rather is the outcome of repeated use of an element that is out of balance. For example, a heat exchanger may stop working too soon because the gas pressure was operating to high, preparing the metal and triggering early deterioration, resulting in cracks and holes. , if that client had received a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure remains in line and safeguards the part.. a very helpful outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, however one that potentially conserved a customer thousands.<p>
