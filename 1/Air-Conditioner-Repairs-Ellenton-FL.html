<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Just today I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the same day. He understood simply what the problem was and repaired it very quickly. However here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my whole air conditioning and gas heat went totally dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
