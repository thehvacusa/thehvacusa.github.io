<h3>Choosing the Right HVAC System For The Project in Mill Creek WA</h3>
<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil change' kind of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface which the tech said 'could' cause an issue in the future. So he stated I could switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and knowledgeable. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
