<h3>Things to Know Before Getting a HVAC Contractor at Melvindale MI</h3>
<p>Luis was immediately responsive to email and texts with concerns. He devoted to the job based only on e-mails, showed up and delivered with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs deal was one of the couple of affordable ones received. Others were nearly two times the amount Protex priced estimate for low end off brand name devices. I got Carrier. ProTex properly encouraged me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more money (Honesty) The install group was considerate of my home and installed the equipment in the anticipated quantity of time. post install examination results look very good for braising and pipes quality. New unit cools better than the 13 years of age 4 ton R22 system it replaced (also Provider).<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is generally an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without airflow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt once again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
