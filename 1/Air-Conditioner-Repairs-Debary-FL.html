<p>The quality of the air inside our schools, work environments and homes matters, especially because we spend most of our lives indoors. Air conditioners help to dehumidify the incoming air, but in incredibly damp environments or in cases where the ac system is oversized, it may not accomplish a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and because the air conditioning system will require more energy to cool your house. A more effective option is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be added as a retrofit to a lot of existing systems.<p>

Make sure that the glycol loop connections to the heat exchanger and the cold and hot water connections are accessible if the heat exchanger is internal to the storage tank. If the heat exchanger is external to the tank, it is likely that it is supported by the pipes. Install unions at the tank and heat exchanger connections so that the piping will not need to be cut if the tank or heat exchanger ever require to be changed.<p>
