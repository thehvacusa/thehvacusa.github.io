Taylor took sufficient time to help us debate which upgrades were cost effective, which upgrades we could do ourselves and what would yield us the largest cost savings. We never felt rushed and Taylor's technical understanding of IES's products and services was excellent. Taylor helped us narrow the scope to an affordable level, a heat pump replacement for our oil furnace, while permitting me to perform the necessary electrical improvements to save money on cost.<p>
<p>When all the tasks have actually been finished, the last task is to test the system to make sure it cools effectively. HVAC systems are run through the thermostat.
