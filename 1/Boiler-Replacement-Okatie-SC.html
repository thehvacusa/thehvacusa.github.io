<h3>Solar Heating System in Okatie South Carolina</h3>
<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and grumbled) When this man belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the residential or commercial property.<p>

In the summer months, the procedure reverses, thus cooling a home by removing heat. Underground temperature stays continuous no matter the environment, so geothermal systems provide constant and reputable heating and cooling.<p>
