<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and then measure the height and width of the opening. When shopping for an air conditioner to ensure it'll fit comfortably into the window, be sure to have those measurements on hand. Also, keep fire safety in mind when choosing where to install the a/c: Don't put it in an egress window that acts as the only means of escape ought to a fire emerge.<p>

<p>Co2 (CO2) might not be the most pernicious element affecting indoor air quality, but it is frequently used as a surrogate for air quality and building occupancy level. The more residents there remain in a room or building, the more CO2 is released into the air. To avoid CO2 levels from increasing expensive-- which can have an unfavorable impact on residents-- outdoors air must be deliberately brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>
