<p>The likelihood of immediate reactions to indoor air contaminants depends on numerous elements. Age and preexisting medical conditions are 2 crucial influences. In other cases, whether a person reacts to a pollutant depends on individual sensitivity, which varies tremendously from individual to individual. Some individuals can end up being sensitized to biological contaminants after duplicated direct exposures, and it appears that some people can end up being sensitized to chemical contaminants also.<p>
<p>Indoor environments are extremely complicated and building occupants may be exposed to a range of contaminants (in the kind of particles and gases) from workplace makers, cleaning products, construction activities, home furnishings and carpets, fragrances, cigarette smoke, water-damaged building materials, microbial development (fungal, mold, and bacterial), bugs, and outside pollutants.

<p>The predominant health effect associated with direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may posture threats, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your threat of lung cancer is particularly high.<p>
