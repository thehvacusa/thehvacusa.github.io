When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in climates where humidity is more of an issue.
