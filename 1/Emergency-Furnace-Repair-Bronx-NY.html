These convection heating systems are still extensively utilized and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered also.<p>

<p>A specialized ac system that is used just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a basic air conditioning system because both the condenser and the evaporator are put in the same air course. A standard a/c unit transfers heat energy out of the room due to the fact that its condenser coil launches heat outside. Nevertheless, since all components of the dehumidifier remain in the exact same space, no heat is eliminated. Rather, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier stays in the space as heat, so the room is really heated up, simply as by an electric heating unit that draws the very same quantity of power.<p>
