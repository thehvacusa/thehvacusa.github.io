<p>We tend to think about air pollution as something outdoors - ozone, haze, or smog hanging in the air, particularly in summertime. These convection heating units are still widely used and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts include the development and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality models, specifically the CONTAM series which predicts airflows and impurity concentrations in multizone building systems.

CONTAM has actually been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transportation in big residential, office, and school buildings.<p>
