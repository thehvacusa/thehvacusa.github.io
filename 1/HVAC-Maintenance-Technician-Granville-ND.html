<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is since ice types on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system need to briefly switch back into the regular cooling mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
