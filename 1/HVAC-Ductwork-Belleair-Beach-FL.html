<h3>The History of Air Source Heat Pumps in Belleair Beach FL</h3>
<p>The remainder of the HVAC system also requires to be in leading condition for the air conditioning unit to work well. This consists of the air handler, evaporator coil, ductwork and signs up, all of which live inside the home. If the specific parts are in proper order, the technician can examine the ductwork for indications of holes, spaces or extreme dirt. Sealing leakages in ductwork can improve HVAC effectiveness by as much as 30 percent, and offer a cooler home in the hot summer.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is usually a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without airflow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try once again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
