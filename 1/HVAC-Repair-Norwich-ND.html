<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. As soon as I decided to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka.

Not just was the price excellent however Mark headed out of his method to personalize a couple of things in my house to make the total air circulation more optimized. I think it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
