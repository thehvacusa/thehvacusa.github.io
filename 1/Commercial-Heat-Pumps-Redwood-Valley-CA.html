<p>There are lots of actions a house owner can take to select items that will prevent indoor air problems from happening - a number of them are discussed here. First, utilize exterior-grade pressed wood items made with phenol-formaldehyde resin in floorings, cabinetry, and wall surface areas. Or, as an option, consider utilizing strong wood items. Secondly, if you prepare to set up wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, particularly concrete in basements, make certain that a reliable moisture barrier is installed prior to setting up the carpet. If it becomes wet, do not completely adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be removed.<p>
