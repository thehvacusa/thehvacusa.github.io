<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is usually a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt once again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
