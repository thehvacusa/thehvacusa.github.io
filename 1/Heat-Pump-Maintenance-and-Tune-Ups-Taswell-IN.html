<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
