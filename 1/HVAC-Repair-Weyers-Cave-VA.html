<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is regularly in the variety of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), due to the fact that heatpump end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system must briefly switch back into the routine cooling mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost.
