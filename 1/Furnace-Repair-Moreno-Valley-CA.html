<p>Fact: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment normally lasts years, since it is secured indoors. When it does require to be changed, the cost is much less than putting in a whole brand-new geothermal system, given that the loop or well is the most expensive to set up. New technical guidelines get rid of the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever.
