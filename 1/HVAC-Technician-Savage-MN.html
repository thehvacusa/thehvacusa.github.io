<p>Air conditioning can likewise be supplied by a procedure called free cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space.

Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added because the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, thereby decreasing its efficiency.<p>
