PTACs, which are regularly used in hotels, have 2 different units (terminal packages), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing unit on the exterior, with an opening travelling through the wall and linking them. This lessens the interior system footprint and allows each space to be changed separately. PTAC systems might be adjusted to supply heating in winter, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to draw and heat the interior heat from the exterior air, converting the air conditioning system into a heatpump While room air conditioning supplies optimum flexibility, when utilized to cool many rooms at a time it is usually more expensive than central air.<p>
