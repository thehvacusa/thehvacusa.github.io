<h3>Knowing the Basics of Furnace, AC and HVAC Maintenance at Goose Creek SC</h3>
<p>Prior to you pick a contractor, think about bids from at least three to 5 respectable contractors. Contact your state's contractor's licensing board online to ensure that no customer problems have been submitted and that the heating and air-conditioning contracting license is valid and active. Compare the numerous furnace performance rankings suggested by the individual contractors to choose the design and system that best fits your energy requires. Keep in mind that energy-star rated equipment will save you cash in the end however might involve a higher up-front cost.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
