<p>Though it may be difficult to believe, the air inside your house can be worse than the air exterior. Dust and dander are well-known for decreasing the air quality in your home, however there are lots of other pollutants that can not just filthy up the air, but result in other health issues. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning materials and structure products add to bad air quality, and can likewise cause cancers.

<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to evaporate, for this reason the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator.

<p>Likewise, there are natural causes for indoor air contamination. For instance, people breathe out co2, which in small amounts is not hazardous, however may become hazardous if high concentrations are allowed to build up. Micro-organisms or bacteria might likewise be present within the ventilation system.
