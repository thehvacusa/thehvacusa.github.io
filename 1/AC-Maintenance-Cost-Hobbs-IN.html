<p>At present, EPA does not suggest utilizing air cleaners to decrease levels of radon and its decay items. Since they just partly remove the radon decay products and do not diminish the amount of radon entering the home, the efficiency of these devices is unpredictable. EPA plans to do extra research on whether air cleaners are, or could become, a trusted means of decreasing the health threat from radon. EPA's brochure, Residential Air-Cleaning Gadgets, provides further info on air-cleaning devices to decrease indoor air toxins.<p>
