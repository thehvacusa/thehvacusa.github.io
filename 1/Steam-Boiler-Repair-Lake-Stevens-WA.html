For instance, a 1 lot system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in tons, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This means a 4.5 lot unit will cool 54,000 BTUs.

<p>Lots of individuals are becoming more conscious and worried about their health and the effect of indoor air quality. Dust and dirt containing contaminants and allergens can cover the a/c ductwork with time.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps become ineffective in more severe cold. This is because ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system should briefly switch back into the routine a/c mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
