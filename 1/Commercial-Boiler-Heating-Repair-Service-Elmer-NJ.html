<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems utilize capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power offered to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to turn on. Gradually, capacitors can wear out, and when they do, you'll see the motor running hotter. Before that happens, you want to get those capacitors changed to avoid more damage to your system.<p>
<p>Next, and maybe just as essential when it comes to central air conditioning costs, is the AC unit's size. An unit that is too large will have a simple time keeping the home cool, but will have a harder time getting rid of humidity from the air. On the other hand, a system that is too small will not have the ability to appropriately cool the home on hot days. Thinking about larger units cost more than smaller sized units, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC system your central air conditioning system needs to hold.<p>
