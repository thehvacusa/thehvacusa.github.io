<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you must watch out for. Initially, you must inspect your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis.

This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively if completely iced over.<p>
