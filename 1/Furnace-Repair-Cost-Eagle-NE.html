<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help determine the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications arise from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate wetness, Air cleaning takes place. The objective is to provide adequate modifications to guarantee a healthy environment. There are a number of kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to achieve this. A common element required in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
