<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company because the two technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
