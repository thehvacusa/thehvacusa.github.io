<p>Bear in mind that the SEER score is calculated utilizing the same set of temperature levels throughout the board. The typical summertime temperature level to come to the SEER score is 83 degrees, so to reach the right SEER rating for your area, subtract 2 points for every 10 degrees over 83. The minimum SEER score has to be at least 13 for all new air conditioning systems manufactured in the United States.<p>
<p>To set up a safe assessment or visit with an HVAC technician throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, start by comparing technicians in your area in an online search. Message or call service technicians to ask whether they can carry out a consultation over the phone or perhaps over a video call.

<p>Normally the most efficient method to enhance indoor air quality is to eliminate individual sources of pollution or to minimize their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas ranges, can be adjusted to decrease the amount of emissions. Oftentimes, source control is also a more cost-efficient approach to securing indoor air quality than increasing ventilation since increasing ventilation can increase energy expenses. Particular sources of indoor air pollution in your house are noted later on in this area.<p>
<p>Biological pollutants include germs, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these contaminants. Pollens originate from plants; infections are sent by animals and individuals; bacteria are brought by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and household pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a potent irritant. When it dries, it can become air-borne. Polluted central air handling systems can become breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then distribute these pollutants through the home.<p>
