He was able to put rise protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no problems other than the blower motor. The only factor he could not set up the new blower motor was because there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the concern is.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and educated. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
