Geothermal HVAC systems begin at about $5,000 per load, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per ton. However, brand-new installation practices are minimizing expenses, to the point where the rate is getting closer to traditional systems under the best conditions.<p>

<p>Sean was really valuable. He is a very enjoyable individual to work with. No pressure used to buy additional things. Answered all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to make certain they were no problems aside from the blower motor. The only reason he could not install the new blower motor was due to the fact that there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the problem is.<p>
