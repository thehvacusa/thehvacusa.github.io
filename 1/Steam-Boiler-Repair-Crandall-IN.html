<p>A packaged unit, usually set up on the roof, is most commonly utilized on commercial buildings, but it is also an alternative for property owners to think about. Oftentimes, these systems contain not only the air conditioning unit itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this system is surely the cost. Packaged systems are terrific for those aiming to save cash on the installation of a new cooling and heating system separately, because the unit is combined. However, one con is that these systems are normally just available for bigger houses due to their high power and capacity. Additionally, while they can be a good way to save money on a total HVAC system, they're still significantly more pricey than purchasing just a cooling system. For that reason, this might not be the very best choice for property owners searching for short-term savings or those with smaller spending plans.<p>
