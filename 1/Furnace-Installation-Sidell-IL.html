<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The ability to cool and heat your house at maximum effectiveness will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is currently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot home will require a much larger AC unit than a smaller sized home, which will impact installation expenses. Likewise a home with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any fractures for air flow will require far less AC capability to keep temperature levels comfortable. Other aspects that can affect this could be the insulation somewhere else such as the structure, roofing system, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts include the advancement and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality designs, particularly the CONTAM series which anticipates air flows and impurity concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic user interface that permits the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and use "icons" to represent air flow paths, ventilation system components, and pollutant sources. CONTAM has actually been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transport in big residential, workplace, and school buildings.<p>

Utilizing existing ductwork will remove the need to set up a pricey new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
