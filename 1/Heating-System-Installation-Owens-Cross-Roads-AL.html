<p>Have actually used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. They give me concern and a lower rate when I have problems. Bought a brand-new primary system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever buy prolonged guarantees or service contracts on anything however HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Great financial investment in my viewpoint. Never attempt to offer me something I don't require.<p>
