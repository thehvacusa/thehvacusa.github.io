<h3>AC Compressor in Valley Park MO</h3>
<p>I have actually been utilizing them for many years for my businesses, my own houses and my realty clients' homes. I went through 5 other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with different prices and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who described to me completely the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC quit working at my rental house. When I called and he recommended me to call warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the system working once again, he helped me trouble shoot the issue. He is sincere, reliable, and reasonable on cost. It's difficult to find an honest AC guy and I'm thankful I discovered Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>

In the past, some poorly sized systems did overheat or overcool the ground over time, to the point that the system no longer had sufficient of a temperature level gradient to function.<p>
