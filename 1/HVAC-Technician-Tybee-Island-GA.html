<h3>Commercial Air Conditioning Repair in Tybee Island Georgia</h3>
<p>If you believe a mold issue-- either because of noticeable growth or a musty odor regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold begins with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and maintain. Leaky return ducts can also present wetness. Again, if you believe a mold issue, consider having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>

<h3>Air Conditioner Servicing in Tybee Island GA</h3>
<p>All modern cooling systems, even small window package units, are geared up with internal air filters. These are typically of a lightweight gauze-like product, and should be replaced or washed as conditions require. For instance, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry pets, will require to have the filters changed more often than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to lost energy, shortened equipment life, and greater energy bills; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. Additionally, very dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.<p>
