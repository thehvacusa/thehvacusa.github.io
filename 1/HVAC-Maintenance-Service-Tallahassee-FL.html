<h3>Choosing the Right HVAC System For The Project in Tallahassee FL</h3>
<p>Another method to reducing the concentrations of indoor air contaminants in your house is to increase the quantity of outdoor air coming inside your home. The majority of house heating and cooling systems, including required air heating unit, do not mechanically bring fresh air into the house. Opening doors and windows, running window or attic fans, when the weather condition allows, or running a window air conditioning system with the vent control open boosts the outside ventilation rate. Local restroom or cooking area fans that tire outdoors get rid of pollutants directly from the room where the fan lies and also increase the outdoor air ventilation rate.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
