Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted right away, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 journeys to collaborate their work with a company that was working on the outdoor patio where the unit sits. I seem like they offer me preferential treatment, and want to pay a little bit more for that peace of mind.<p>
