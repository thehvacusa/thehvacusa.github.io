<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor workplace, class or laboratory environments, instead of outdoor or industrial settings. In tasks where union membership is not an issue, an HVAC technician may complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This consists of cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, attaching the ducts to the HVAC system, and installing the ductwork in the building. It may also include the installation of signs up where the ductwork links to specific spaces.<p>
<p>A ducted heat pump appears like a big central air conditioner system that sits outside your home. Heatpump work on electrical energy and work like air conditioning system in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outside air. This permits them to produce 2 to 3 times as much heat as a standard electric heating system (like an area heating unit) with the very same amount of electrical energy. They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>
