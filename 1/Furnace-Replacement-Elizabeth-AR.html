<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to finish. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. Once I decided to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the price terrific but Mark went out of his method to tailor a few things in my home to make the overall air flow more enhanced. I believe it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I believe any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
