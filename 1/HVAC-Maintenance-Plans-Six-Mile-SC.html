<p>RMI is working to change that, beginning in California. As a primary step, in April RMI testified before the California Air Resources Board, asking the agency to set stronger indoor guidelines based on the most current science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to control indoor devices through codes, and after more powerful standards are set there is an opportunity to deal with enforcement.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of co2 for functions of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged duration of stable tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure carbon dioxide must be adjusted often, and outside measurements used for estimations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level results on measurements made outdoors might likewise be needed.<p>

There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
