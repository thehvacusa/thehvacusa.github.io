<p>Heating is the biggest energy expense in the typical house. In really dry environments, evaporative coolers, sometimes referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water.

The temperature level of the inbound air is decreased, but it is also more humid, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is the same. A few of the practical heat of the getting in air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The results can be rather significant if the getting in air is dry enough.<p>

All-electric boilers can attain approximately 95 to 100 percent AFUE, according to the DOE. Newer gas boilers should accomplish 80 percent AFUE and more recent fossil-fueled boilers should accomplish a 75 percent AFUE.<p>
