Generally this leaves about 6% of incomes to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't seem like much, particularly if the objective of owning a business was for monetary freedom. Plus, this 6% wants the few years it took to construct business and not taking an earnings as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% normally isn't the end goal. HVAC company owner must strive for 10-15% by cutting expenses in some areas or increasing their earnings while keeping expenses the exact same in all other areas.<p>
