We understand about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air contaminants are typically 2 to 5 times greater than outside levels, and in some cases these levels can go beyond 100 times that of outside levels of the exact same pollutants. In other words, often the air inside can be more harmful than the air outside.<p>
<p>Reality: Federal and local rewards typically amount to in between 30 and 60 percent of overall geothermal system cost, which can typically make the preliminary cost of a system competitive with standard devices. Requirement air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per ton of heating or cooling capability, throughout brand-new construction (homes generally utilize in between one and five loads). Geothermal HVAC systems begin at about $5,000 per load, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per heap.
