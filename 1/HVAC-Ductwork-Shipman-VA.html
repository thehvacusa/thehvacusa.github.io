<p>Current Review: They were excellent! Many HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to provide you with the service initially asked for. They fulfilled my needs totally by supplying a professional quote with choices, without pushing additional items. The crew appeared on time, kept me notified as they worked, and finished a little early. The likewise immediately followed up with the required evaluations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely suggest this company.<p>
<p>What do you do when the company that's providing the service agreement tries to upsell you every time they pertain to carry out routine maintenance? If the coils were cleaned up in March 2015, why would they be showing "extreme rust" in June 2015 and require a deep cleaning for $400? They offered her a Reme Halo for $1,300, offering her a 10% discount if she renewed her PMA for 7 years, even though it was 6 months prior to the existing one ended. She didn't require a air purification system, but they talked her into it.<p>
