<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outdoors - smog, ozone, or haze hanging in the air, especially in summertime.

This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>Radiant heat covers a variety of various heater, consisting of electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heat systems run on similar principles.

When it comes to electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements. As the hot water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the floor and into the space.<p>
