<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly steady in time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a structure as reasonably the same physical material with time. In truth, the true nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and understood as intricate systems. Research using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
