<p>We tend to consider air pollution as something outdoors - smog, ozone, or haze hanging in the air, specifically in summer season. These convection heaters are still widely utilized and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or gas, but some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>Central air conditioners are more efficient than room ac system. In addition, they run out the way, quiet, and convenient to operate.

In an average air-conditioned house, a/c takes in more than 2,000 kilowatt-hours of electrical power per year, triggering power plants to produce about 3,500 pounds of carbon dioxide and 31 pounds of sulfur dioxide.<p>
