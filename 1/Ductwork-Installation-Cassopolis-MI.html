<p>The main problem when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external system to the internal ones. While setting up a separate split system, employees attempt to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system produces more difficulties, given that some of indoor units can be situated far from the exterior. The first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not permit you to set the a/c separately for each room. However, now the market has a broad choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional attributes of indoor systems run independently from each other.<p>
