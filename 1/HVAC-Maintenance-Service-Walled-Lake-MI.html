<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Just this morning I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the very same day. He understood simply what the issue was and repaired it very quickly. However here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my entire cooling and gas heat went totally dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>

<h3>Commercial Air Conditioning Repair in Walled Lake MI</h3>
<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so work with your contractor to find a location that's not near a bedroom or home-office window. Since it tires warm air out the top, don't place the condenser under a deck or entirely enclose it. Any airflow limitation will decrease the system's efficiency. You can, however, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily flow around it.<p>
<p>Excellent service within 24 hr and a reasonable cost. The technician (Camryn) was extremely thorough and on-time in describing what services would be performed. Similarly Camryn offered terrific client service at the end of the consultation by explaining exactly what he had done, the condition of our heat pump, furnace and tankless hot water heater. He made a few recommendations of some maintenance tasks we might wish to have done in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale techniques used by some in the market.<p>
<p>Normally the most reliable method to enhance indoor air quality is to eliminate specific sources of contamination or to lower their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas stoves, can be adapted to reduce the quantity of emissions. In most cases, source control is likewise a more cost-efficient method to safeguarding indoor air quality than increasing ventilation due to the fact that increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Specific sources of indoor air contamination in your house are listed later in this section.<p>
<p>Advanced designs of new homes are starting to include mechanical systems that bring outside air into the home. Some of these styles consist of energy-efficient heat recovery ventilators (likewise referred to as air-to-air heat exchangers). For more details about air-to-air heat exchangers, contact the Conservation and Renewable Resource Query and Recommendation Service (CAREIRS), PO Box 3048, Merrifield, VA 22116; (800) 523-2929.<p>
