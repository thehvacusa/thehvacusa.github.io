<h3>Determining Heat Pump Efficiency in Trafford AL</h3>
<p>During winter season, the ground source heat is soaked up by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid distributes around this loop, transmitting the absorbed heat to a refrigerant by means of the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas. From here it goes through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct result of the compression process. From here, the gas transfers to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heating unit.<p>

I am currently on the maintance strategy. He takes care of it twice a year with out needing to be reminded to do it.<p>
