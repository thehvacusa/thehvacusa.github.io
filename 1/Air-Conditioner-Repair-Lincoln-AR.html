<p>EER stands for Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air systems is measured by the variety of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a traditional unit of heat; it is defined as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The normal set conditions are outdoor temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why many people do not use this measurement much any longer.<p>

<p>Watch out for signs of water leaks or flooding to stop mold from growing. Porous products, floor, ceiling, and wall coverings, and furniture found in the basements that have actually been wet for over 24 to two days might end up being a source for mold development and must be disposed of. Often there is a moldy odor but mold can not be seen. Mold does not require light to grow and can flourish in hidden or rarely accessed locations of your home, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a range of surface areas: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on floor covering materials including carpet underpadding. Chances are there will be mold growing nearby if a source of water or condensation can be found. Fix the wetness issue, either by locating the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Thoroughly tidy the location utilizing established health department suggestions.<p>
