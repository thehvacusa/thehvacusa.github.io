<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might think. Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, economical flexible hose pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to tear and wear and is quickly pierced.<p>
