They can lead to a hazardous build-up and jeopardize your security if the exhaust outlets are obstructed.

They will try to find signs of rust, leakages, and back draft and repair the issue during their maintenance runs.<p>
<p>A cars and truck's coolant system transfers excess heat from one part of the engine and lastly loses it through the radiator fins. With time, the coolant becomes old and unclean.

A coolant flush is standard maintenance for your vehicle's cooling system. Call 206-523-2133 or check out Acme Car Electric & Repair in Seattle, WA 98103 for all your coolant system flush and fill requirements.<p>
