<p>Some cooling systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly referred to as "reverse cycle ac system". The heatpump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit likewise switches functions to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outside air).<p>

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is since ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system should temporarily switch back into the regular cooling mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
