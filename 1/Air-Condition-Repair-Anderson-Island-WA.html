<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, relatively stable in time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a structure as relatively unchanged physical product gradually. In fact, the real nature of structures can be deemed the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and comprehended as complicated systems. Research study using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
