<p>We contacted Elite A/C on one of the most popular days of summer( we had no central air for 2weeks) and they sent some1 out very same day to evaluate scenario & chose to go with them for the work. I more than happy to state that not just did we get the central air going but also replaced the heating unit which was old. Everyone we talked to from starting to end were really expert, polite and the work was extremely efficiently done. I would highly recommend this company.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>The piping-- which is woven throughout the floor as a circulation system. Metal pipes are rarely utilized due to long-lasting destructive issues. Virtually all hydronic radiant floor heat systems today use 1/2 inch diameter plastic tubing made from PEX or Cross-linked Polyethylene piping. PEX is highly versatile, will not rust and comes in long lengths, which allow PEX pipe to be woven with very little or no joints.<p>
<p>The early couple of years of your company are an exciting time, and it's appealing to let pure interest direct your course forward. However if you want your new HVAC service to have remaining power, you must go back and commit the required time to establishing a business strategy. And bear in mind that a service plan for an HVAC company isn't indicated to be a fixed document. It's a framework to direct the launch or revamp of your business that you can build upon and restructure as the business evolves.<p>
