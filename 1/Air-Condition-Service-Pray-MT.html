<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these three things first. Make sure all the signs up in your home are large open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If several registers were closed or the filter was obstructed, the reduced airflow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or until there's good airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've fixed the problem.<p>
