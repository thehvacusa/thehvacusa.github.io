<p>For every single load of laundry you dry, that moisture has to go somewhere. If your clothes dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're simply asking for mold accumulation, states Dr. Khatri.

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your cars and truck's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation.

When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine might harm the engine elements. To prevent this from taking place, have your radiator serviced routinely.
