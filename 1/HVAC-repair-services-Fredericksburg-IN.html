<p>SysTech Design focuses on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for enhancing and preserving the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment. The exact same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it distributes through your home. Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to stick to and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils ensures dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from building up on and below the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>

<p>Just like the majority of home improvement projects, the cost of a full central heating system can differ extensively based on the size of the house. Many heaters will last between 15 and twenty years. In choosing a furnace, property owners need to consider heat output and efficiency. Heat output is measured in British Thermal Systems, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace should be matched to the size of the home. A small house, for instance, may not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace might heat the house too quickly and shut down for too long, leading to irregular temperature level levels.<p>
