<p>The federal government suggests that homes be weatherized in order to reduce the amount of energy needed for heating & cooling. While weatherization is underway, nevertheless, steps must also be required to reduce contamination from sources inside the home. (See "Improving the Air Quality in Your Home" for recommended actions.) In addition, homeowners should be alert to the development of indications of inadequate ventilation, such as stuffy air, moisture condensation on cold surfaces, or mold and mildew development. Extra weatherization measures ought to not be undertaken till these issues have been fixed.<p>
<p>We look at ideas before we provide recommendations to change instead of repair a heating system. One of the hints we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy costs are high compared to usage, or if energy costs are higher year after year, we know the system is not running efficiently. It may be in ideal condition, however if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to replace it with a more efficient model, then you would be losing cash by not replacing the older system.<p>
