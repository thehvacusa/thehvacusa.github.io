<h3>HVAC Maintenance in Krum TX</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might believe. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a small, low-cost flexible pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to tear and wear and is easily pierced.<p>
<p>Oil heaters are normally not very efficient. They use less fuel than other furnace types, however many do not accomplish an effectiveness higher than 90%. A few high-end brands have a performance of 95% by using a condenser. These are more costly, having starting expenses for the furnace itself at around $5,000. You pay more for the installation too due to the fact that a drain requires to be installed.<p>
