<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is normally a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>

<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Integrity Energy was quick to respond when I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our 2 furnaces were not working. They appeared the next day and changed two heating systems and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday till the new furnaces can heat your house. Honestly, our house heating unit is complicated, Rob and his group repaired the old duct, changed all the dampers, make the entire system work perfectly.<p>
