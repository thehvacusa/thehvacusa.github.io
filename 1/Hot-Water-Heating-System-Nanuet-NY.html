<p>When the heat pump headed out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was extremely handy in gathering details on the phone and providing clear guidelines about how to briefly deal with the issue and prepare the heat pump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly effective and offered clear communication about the problem, its treatments, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi started.

<p>Have utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They give me priority and a lower rate when I have issues. Bought a new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever buy extended service warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great investment in my opinion. Never attempt to sell me something I do not require.<p>
