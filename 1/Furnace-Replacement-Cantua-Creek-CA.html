<p>Indoor Air Quality Guide: Finest Practices for Style, Building And Construction and Commissioning is created for designers, design engineers, contractors, commissioning representatives, and all other professionals concerned with indoor air quality. Sources of formaldehyde in the home include building materials, smoking cigarettes, household items, and using unvented, fuel-burning appliances, like gas stoves or kerosene space heating systems.

<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding job locating the outside system as close to the house as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left tidy during and after the work.

He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
