<p>I normally do not leave reviews however wished to share my experience. You do not anticipate needing to replace your AC system. Unfortunately for us, we had no other alternative. What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my alternatives. After organisation hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and discuss options. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household pal and now I will suggest this company to my buddies.<p>
<p>G&S did an excellent task installing our brand-new furnace and AC unit. The very best aspect of G&S is that they service warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace failed within a number of months (no fault of G&S). Producers warranty would cover the parts cost but G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their warranty. Likewise they detected the concern and repaired extremely quickly. Absolutely A++ installation and service.<p>
