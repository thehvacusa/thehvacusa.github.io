<p>When your HVAC professional tells you to alter your filters regularly, they're not kidding. It's as important as a regular oil modification in your vehicle.

Additionally, a fresh, tidy filter better traps contaminants and debris in the air. As soon as every three months, Energy Star recommends replacing your filter. Throughout high use months, inspect the filters a minimum of month-to-month.<p>
