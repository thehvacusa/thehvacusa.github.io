If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, because something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>

<p>Central air conditioning units are measured in lots. This measurement is based upon the unit's capability to cool your home. For instance, a 1 heap system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 boost in loads, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 heap unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it indicates the quantity of energy needed to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F Â°.<p>
