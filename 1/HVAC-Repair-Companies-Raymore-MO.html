<h3>Gas Central Heating Systems in Raymore MO - The Benefits</h3>
<p>We found Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were very pleased that somebody as experienced as Adam was able to return and repair the air conditioner. We had purchased the club member maintenance strategy, which helped offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our suggestion to any property buyers: work with Blue Flame to test the ac system before you buy. We purchased this home in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, but Adam stated he had ways to check AC units even in winter season. We want we had actually understood him then.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't successful you wouldn't offer them.. Second of all like extended automobile warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the essential skills to do the job and likewise the morals to treat clients relatively. As a consumer you require to be well informed in order not to be completely benefited from. A lot of companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally discovered somebody to effectively service and the system has been operating issue complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
