<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar earned to his employees, devices expenses, marketing, utilities, and other expenses before paying himself anything. Generally this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay.
