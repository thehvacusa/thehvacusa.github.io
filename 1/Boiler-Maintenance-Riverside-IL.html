<p>Heating is the largest energy cost in the typical house. In extremely dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature of the incoming air is decreased, but it is also more damp, so the overall heat (reasonable heat plus latent heat) is the same. Some of the sensible heat of the entering air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The outcomes can be rather significant if the getting in air is dry enough.<p>
