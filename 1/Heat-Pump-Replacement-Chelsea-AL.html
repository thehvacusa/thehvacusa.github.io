<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Just this morning I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the same day. He understood just what the issue was and fixed it extremely rapidly. However here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my entire a/c and gas heat went absolutely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning assistance determine the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes arise from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove wetness, Air cleaning takes place. The goal is to provide sufficient changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be installed to accomplish this. A typical element needed in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) offers guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
