<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Just take an image of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you might need a recommendation later on). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp connectors should snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the port and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you have actually switched all the wires, protect the brand-new capacitor (Picture 5).<p>
