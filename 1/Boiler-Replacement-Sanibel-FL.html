<p>EER represents Energy Performance Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air units is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As discussed above, a BTU is a traditional system of heat; it is defined as the quantity of heat needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The common set conditions are outside temps of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why the majority of people don't utilize this measurement much anymore.<p>
<p>Air pollutants can range from impurities generated from the outdoors by your family pets to hazardous gas leakages.

<p>Humid and wet conditions breed mold and mildew that can activate respiratory issues like allergies and asthma. Depending upon your location, the hot summer months can produce particularly damp conditions. Minimize the quantity of moisture in the air and suppress the development of irritating molds with a couple of well-placed dehumidifiers. There are a range of humidifier alternatives that will help maintain consistent humidity levels and produce comfy living conditions in your home.<p>
