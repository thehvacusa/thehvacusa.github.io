<h3>The Benefits of Regular HVAC Maintenance at Atwood IL</h3>
<p>The icing problem ends up being much more extreme with lower outside temperature levels, so heat pumps are frequently set up in tandem with a more traditional form of heating, such as an electrical heating system, a natural gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is used rather of the heat pump during harsher winter season temperature levels. In this case, the heat pump is utilized efficiently during the milder temperature levels, and the system is switched to the standard heat source when the outside temperature is lower.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was polite and experienced. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
