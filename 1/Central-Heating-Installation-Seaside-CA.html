<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was really clear and quick about his inspection, guaranteeing I understood what was watched out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So maybe a little high on price for this service, but the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
<p>An undersize system will not have the ability to cool spaces down completely on the hottest days and will cost more to operate since it needs to run longer than a correctly sized unit.

That's since it cools the air so rapidly that it turns off prior to it has an opportunity to flow the proper volume of air past the coils to draw out the required moisture. The outcome is a room that does not appear as cool as the temperature level shows. In reality, the space can feel clammy and moist.<p>
