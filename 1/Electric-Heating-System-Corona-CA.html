Set the thermostat to a temperature level listed below the room temperature level, and after that change it ON. To avoid straining an air conditioning system's compressor, wait at least five minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on.

<h3>Heating And Air Conditioning Maintenance in Corona CA</h3>
<p>I usually do not leave evaluations but wanted to share my experience. You don't expect having to change your AC system. Unfortunately for us, we had no other option. What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my choices. After service hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and go over choices. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will suggest this company to my buddies.<p>
