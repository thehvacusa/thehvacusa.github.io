<p>A blocked furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut off. Dirty filters are the most typical reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt limit air flow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will overheat and shut off too rapidly, and your house will not warm up. Replace the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. An unclean filter likewise causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, reducing the efficiency of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
