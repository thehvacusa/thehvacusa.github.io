<p>The guidelines that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfy completing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We recommend you do the same. When the circuitry is complete, energize the system for a few minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable television heats. Don't put the system into full operation up until the thin-set and grout have had time to appropriately harden and cure-- usually two to 4 weeks. Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm bathroom floor.<p>
<p>Once the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high adequate temperature level, a blower fan will begin to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger enables air to be warmed without coming in contact with the real flame or burner area. Once it reaches an adequate temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the home's duct, supplying warm air to individual bed rooms, living spaces and kitchen areas through the vents or registers.<p>
