<p>Unpredictable organic substances (VOCs)-- These are the main contributors to poor indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both inside your home and outdoors.

<p>It is common to presume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly stable gradually. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as relatively unchanged physical material over time. In fact, the real nature of buildings can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and understood as complex systems. Research study applying the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
