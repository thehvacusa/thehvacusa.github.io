<p>A geothermal heat pump is one of the most energy effective techniques of heating or cooling a home. Counting on a series of liquid-filled pipes, a home can be heated in cooler months by condensing and moving energy from the 50- to 60-degree temperatures found simply a few feet below ground. In the summer season, the procedure reverses, therefore cooling a home by eliminating heat. Underground temperature level remains continuous no matter the climate, so geothermal systems supply reputable and consistent heating & cooling.<p>
<p>You could update to the greatest performance gear offered and still not feel conveniently cool on hot days. That's because the mechanicals are just part of the central air conditioning system. The typical house's ductwork leaks 10% to 30% of its air before it can reach your living space, according to Pacific Gas & Electric. Before choosing whether to repair or replace your condenser and blower systems, your technician needs to run a duct-leakage test, by sealing the vents and measuring how much air escapes the system.<p>
