<p>Given that the 1980s, producers of HVAC devices have actually been making an effort to make the systems they manufacture more effective. This was originally driven by rising energy costs, and has more just recently been driven by increased awareness of ecological concerns.

<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for a/c repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. First, you should examine your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis.

This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
