<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to complete. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. Once I chose to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the cost great however Mark went out of his way to personalize a couple of things in my home to make the total air flow more optimized. I think it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I believe any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<h3>Heating Service in Reevesville SC</h3>
<p>If you set it too low, you're motivating the growth of mold in moist air. The heat dries out the air, avoiding mold growth and pollution. Obviously, too-dry air can also aggravate your sinuses and lungs, while too much indoor humidity can contribute to the development of bacteria and infections, according to a 2018 study in the International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health. The perfect humidity in a home is around 50 percent, according to the American Lung Association.<p>
<p>Indoor contaminants. These consist of chemicals used in the construction or renovation of structures (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning compounds). In addition, appliances that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide gas Insufficient combustion and poor ventilation of these devices (cook ranges, gas heaters, gas boilers, and gas water heaters) can contribute to indoor impurities. Gas cook tops should be used with fans that send exhaust exterior. Gas-fired heating devices must be sealed and power-vented systems installed to remove products of incomplete combustion. Wood-burning stoves can also produce particulates and should be vented outside.<p>
