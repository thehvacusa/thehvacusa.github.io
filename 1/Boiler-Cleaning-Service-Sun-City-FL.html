<h3>Air Conditioner Reviews in Sun City Florida</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a routine inspection. The tech appeared right on time and was experienced & friendly throughout the visit. They suggested replacing a few parts that were heading out. They weren't low-cost however a quick internet search confirmed WSE wasn't inflating rates, so I happily had them changed. However, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in very same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was faulty. No charge for the go to or the brand-new part. I was really delighted they stood by their work and repaired the issue. Will definitely be utilizing them once again.<p>

<p>Reinstall the gain access to panel and detach block. Turn on the circuit breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature level and wait for the AC to begin (see Be Patient at Startup," listed below). The compressor should run and the condenser fan need to spin. The fan motor is most likely shot if the compressor begins but the fan doesn't. Shut down the power and remove the screws around the condenser cover. Raise the cover and eliminate the fan blade and motor (Picture 7). Reinstall the blade and protect the cover. Then repower the system and see if the fan begins. , if it doesn't, you've offered it your best shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>
