<p>The possibility of instant reactions to indoor air toxins depends upon several factors. Age and preexisting medical conditions are 2 important influences.

<p>It is common to presume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly stable in time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a structure as reasonably unchanged physical material with time. In fact, the true nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research study using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
