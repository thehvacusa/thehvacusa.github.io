<p>To say there are a lot of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. It's a little-known fact that the quality and cleanliness of your air ductwork is just as crucial as your HVAC system. Dust and gunk will frequently develop in ductwork, restricting air flow.

The first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not enable you to set the cooling separately for each room. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a wide choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor systems operate individually from each other.<p>
