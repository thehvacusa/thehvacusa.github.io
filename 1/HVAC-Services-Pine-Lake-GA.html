<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you would not use them.  Second of all like extended automobile service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the necessary abilities to do the task and also the morals to treat clients fairly. As a client you need to be well informed in order not to be completely taken advantage of. Most companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to properly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Finally found someone to effectively service and the system has been running problem totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
