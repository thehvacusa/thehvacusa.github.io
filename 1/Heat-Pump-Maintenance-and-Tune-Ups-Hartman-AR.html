<h3>Heat Pump Cost in Hartman AR</h3>
<p>Ducted heat pump heating and cooling systems act much like conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas by means of a duct system.

Utilizing existing ductwork will eliminate the need to set up an expensive brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>

Insulation exposed to sunlight can be secured by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation used outside must be secured with PVC insulation covers.<p>
