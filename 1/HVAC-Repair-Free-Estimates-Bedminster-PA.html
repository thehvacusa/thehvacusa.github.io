<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the vehicle debit, although my company does not offer vehicle debit many companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of money coming in every month, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. , if we do decide to offer auto debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Agreement..
