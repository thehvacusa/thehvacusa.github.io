<p>Weatherization typically does not cause indoor air problems by adding brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes release pollutants.)

As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the home can increase.<p>

The two operations use different procedures, with geothermal energy requiring water be heated up to boiling point to achieve its goals.<p>
