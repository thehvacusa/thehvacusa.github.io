Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>

<p>When the heat pump headed out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was very valuable in gathering information on the phone and providing clear instructions about how to temporarily handle the issue and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely efficient and used clear interaction about the issue, its treatments, and its future prevention. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will certainly use Stability Energy Systems again, for workplace and house.<p>
<p>The instructions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfy completing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the brand-new breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrician. We recommend you do the same. Once the wiring is complete, energize the system for a couple of minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable television heats. Don't put the system into complete operation up until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to properly solidify and treat-- generally two to 4 weeks. Then call the household together and play a video game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm restroom flooring.<p>
