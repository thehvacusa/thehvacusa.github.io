<p>Current Review: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and respectful. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
