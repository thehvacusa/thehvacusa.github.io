Older units from the 1970s may be rated 65%, meaning 35% of the heating energy is lost during the combustion procedure. Today's models range from a minimum of 78% as much as 98.5%. If your home already has ducts, replacing your heating system with a brand-new, effective gas furnace is a reasonably straightforward process.
