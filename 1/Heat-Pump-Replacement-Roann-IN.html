<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might believe. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a little, economical flexible hose pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to tear and use and is easily pierced.<p>
<p>A vehicle's coolant system transfers excess heat from one part of the engine and finally loses it through the radiator fins. With time, the coolant becomes dirty and old.

A coolant flush is standard maintenance for your automobile's cooling system. Call 206-523-2133 or go to Acme Car Electric & Repair in Seattle, WA 98103 for all your coolant system flush and fill requirements.<p>
