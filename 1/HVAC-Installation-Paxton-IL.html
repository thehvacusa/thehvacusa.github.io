<p>Specialist heating system setups. However, even the best-maintained heater will ultimately fail. HVAC specialists advise following this standard rule when choosing whether it deserves buying a repair: If the system is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost majority the cost of a new system, it's best to buy new. At the 15-year mark, it may be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system won't have many more years left in it, and it's likely to be utilizing more energy than required.<p>
