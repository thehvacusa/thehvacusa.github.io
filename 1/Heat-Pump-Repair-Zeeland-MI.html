<p>Sean was extremely valuable. He is a really pleasant individual to deal with. No pressure used to purchase extra stuff. Answered all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to ensure they were no concerns besides the blower motor. The only factor he could not install the new blower motor was since there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the problem is.<p>
