Office temperature levels must be maintained between 68 degrees- 75 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity levels in between 30%- 60%. In addition, drafts brought on by too much air flow must be avoided.<p>
<p>If the AC does not switch off, it might be time to clean the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils will not give off heat efficiently and will keep the system running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have bonded together-- something that can happen with time because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay.

<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you should keep an eye out for. First, you should examine your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis.

This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly if totally iced over.<p>
