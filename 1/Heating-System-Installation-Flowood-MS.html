<p>If you presume a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of noticeable development or a musty smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it does not remove the mold. Mold begins with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and keep. Leaky return ducts can likewise present wetness. Once again, if you suspect a mold issue, think about having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>

If there's a difference in the temperature level, the technician requires to check the thermostat's efficiency or evaluate the whole HVAC system.<p>
