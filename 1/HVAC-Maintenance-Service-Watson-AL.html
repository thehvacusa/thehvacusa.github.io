<h3>The Basics of Central Heating and Air Conditioning in Watson AL</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government company, carried out a research study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it lowers energy expenses by improving air flow. After checking 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no substantial improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy effectiveness. Sometimes, measured particle levels actually increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
