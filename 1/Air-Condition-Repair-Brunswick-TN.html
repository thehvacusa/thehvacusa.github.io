<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment typically lasts decades, because it is protected indoors. When it does need to be replaced, the expense is much less than putting in a whole brand-new geothermal system, because the loop or well is the most costly to install. New technical guidelines eliminate the problem of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some improperly sized systems did overcool the ground or get too hot gradually, to the point that the system no longer had sufficient of a temperature level gradient to operate.<p>

If the existing system has not incurred other major repairs, is in otherwise exceptional condition, and concerns that led to the breakdown can be identified and fixed, repairing the system can make a lot of sense too.<p>
