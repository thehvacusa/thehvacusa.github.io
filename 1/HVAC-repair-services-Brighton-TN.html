<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â The majority of heating systems have multiple control panel. The largest, or only one in some heating systems, is in some cases called the Motherboard. The circuit boards manage and collaborate the operation of the motors, sensing units, ignitor, gas valve and more. DIY repair is possible, but the new control board need to be set up precisely right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the problem isnâ $ t correctly diagnosed, altering a board wonâ $ t repair it, and boards are not returnable once set up. Itâ $ s a good idea to leave this repair to a professional to diagnose.<p>
