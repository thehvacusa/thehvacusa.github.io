<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is ESSENTIAL to maintain the efficiency and efficiency of your HVAC system, numerous research studies through DOE and ACCA can validate this if you're interested. Nevertheless, choose your contractor carefully, a number of the 'trustworthy' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to improper sales strategies that DO benefit from uninformed house owners. Once again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda. While Angie's list is an excellent base line indicator that you MIGHT be dealing with a reliable company, you still need to do your homework (not all contractors with a similar rating are the same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Second, identification of contaminant sources is typically vital to identifying the cause( s) of worker health symptoms. Such information can sometimes be gotten by requesting copies of air monitoring data from the employer. If keeping an eye on data is not readily available, yet a high number of health signs have been reported, the Union agent need to request that the company have air tracking tests performed. Evaluation of this data may identify potentially harmful sources of contamination and resultant employee health symptoms. However, when contaminant concentrations are really low, keeping an eye on data may not explain the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
