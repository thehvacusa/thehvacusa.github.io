<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 professionals I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
