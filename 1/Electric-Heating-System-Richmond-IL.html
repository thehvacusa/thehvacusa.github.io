<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps become inefficient in more severe cold.

Some heatpump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
