All five other companies quoted me with various prices and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who explained to me completely the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC stopped working at my rental home. When I called and he recommended me to get in touch with service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the unit working again, he helped me trouble shoot the issue. He is truthful, trustworthy, and affordable on price. It's hard to find a sincere AC man and I'm grateful I discovered Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>
