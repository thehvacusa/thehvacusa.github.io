<p>Sean was very handy. He is an extremely pleasant person to work with. No pressure applied to buy extra things. Responded to all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to ensure they were no issues other than the blower motor. Due to the fact that there was not one on hand, the only factor he could not install the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the concern is.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is generally a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter.

If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
