For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after a prolonged duration of constant occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable sign of ventilation adequacy.
