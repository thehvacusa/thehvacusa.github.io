The efficiency of an air cleaner depends on how well it collects contaminants from indoor air (expressed as a portion efficiency rate) and just how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering element (revealed in cubic feet per minute).

<p>Reality: Federal and local rewards normally total up to between 30 and 60 percent of overall geothermal system cost, which can typically make the initial price of a system competitive with standard devices.
