<p>3. Gas Heating systems While the cost of heating your home with a gas furnace is generally higher than many heat pump choices, they can still be highly efficient, depending upon the model you buy. Among the primary benefits of gas heating is that due to the combustion process, it will heat the air to higher temperatures than other heating choices. This means it can warm up your house to the wanted temperature quicker than a heatpump can.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning aid identify the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications result from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove moisture, Air cleaning takes place. The goal is to offer adequate changes to guarantee a healthy environment. There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be set up to accomplish this. A common element required in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) offers guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
