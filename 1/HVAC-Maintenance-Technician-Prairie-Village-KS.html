<p>When our furnace was passing away, we contacted 2 local companies for quotes. While both were useful and helpful, Ballard Gas offered us a much better deal, for remarkable service. Instead of a basic sales job, the owner of the company made a complete evaluation of our heater and located methods we could have more even heat. He consisted of these significant but small modifications in his bid. We decided to change from a gas furnace to an electric heatpump because of current warmer summertimes and for environmental reasons.<p>
<p>Reinstall the access panel and detach block. Turn on the breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature and wait for the AC to begin (see Be Patient at Startup," below). The compressor ought to run and the condenser fan need to spin. If the compressor starts however the fan doesn't, the fan motor is probably shot. Turn off the power and remove the screws around the condenser cover. Raise the cover and eliminate the fan blade and motor (Picture 7). Reinstall the blade and protect the cover. Then repower the system and see if the fan begins. , if it does not, you've offered it your best shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>
