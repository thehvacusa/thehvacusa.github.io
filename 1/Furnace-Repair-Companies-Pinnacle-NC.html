Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded right away, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 trips to collaborate their work with a company that was dealing with the outdoor patio where the unit sits. I seem like they provide me favoritism, and want to pay a bit more for that peace of mind.<p>
