<p>Ducted heatpump cooling and heating systems act similar to standard central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas via a duct system.

Utilizing existing ductwork will eliminate the requirement to set up an expensive brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>Equipment costs are driven by the type of furnace at the heart of your house heater. Low-efficiency models will cost less, however result in higher energy expenses.

Electric heating systems begin at $395 and range approximately $1,700 or more depending upon the brand and furnace size.<p>
<p>There is no easy answer, but lots of utilize the general rule that if a repair adds up to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, replacing is probably a better service.
