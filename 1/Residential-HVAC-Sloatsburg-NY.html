<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you should watch out for. First, you should examine your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, but ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
