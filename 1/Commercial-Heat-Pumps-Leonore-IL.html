<p>To put this merely, Preventative maintenance is VITAL TO maintain the efficiency and performance of your HVAC system, multiple studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. However, pick your contractor carefully, much of the 'reputable' contractors touted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to inappropriate sales strategies that DO take advantage of uninformed property owners.
