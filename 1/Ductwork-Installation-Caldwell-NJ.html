<p>People working in buildings with bad IAQ may discover moldy or undesirable odors or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about signs that happen at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more serious problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ problems. Talk to your doctor about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting even worse. However not all exposures cause signs, so there is no replacement for excellent building management.<p>
<p>Consider potential impacts of indoor air pollution if you utilize an unvented kerosene or gas space heater. Follow the maker's directions, particularly instructions on the appropriate fuel and keeping the heater appropriately adjusted. A persistent yellow-tipped flame is normally a sign of maladjustment and increased toxin emissions. While a space heater remains in usage, open a door from the room where the heater lies to the remainder of the house and open a window slightly.<p>
