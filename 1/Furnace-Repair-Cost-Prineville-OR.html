<p>Even if your central air conditioner is just eight to ten years old, it could suck up to two times the electrical energy that even a low-end brand-new one would utilize. That's because it operates at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio, which is the quantity of energy needed to offer a specific cooling output. Until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, but nowadays, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical usage and 30% lower cooling expenses than equipment set up just a few years earlier.<p>
<p>When your HVAC expert tells you to change your filters frequently, they're not kidding. It's as vital as a routine oil change in your vehicle. A dirty filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and eventually reduce its life through wear and tear. Additionally, a fresh, tidy filter better traps pollutants and debris in the air. Energy Star suggests replacing your filter as soon as every 3 months. Throughout high usage months, examine the filters a minimum of month-to-month.<p>
