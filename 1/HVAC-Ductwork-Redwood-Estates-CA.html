Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted right away, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 journeys to coordinate their work with a company that was dealing with the outdoor patio where the unit sits. I seem like they provide me favoritism, and am willing to pay a little bit more for that assurance.<p>
