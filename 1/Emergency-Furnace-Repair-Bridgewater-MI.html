<p>Another approach to decreasing the concentrations of indoor air toxins in your house is to increase the amount of outside air coming inside. Most home heating and cooling systems, consisting of forced air heating systems, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your home. Opening doors and windows, operating window or attic fans, when the weather permits, or running a window a/c unit with the vent control open boosts the outside ventilation rate. Local bathroom or kitchen area fans that exhaust outdoors get rid of contaminants straight from the room where the fan lies and likewise increase the outdoor air ventilation rate.<p>
<p>Room a/c include a thermostat sensor, located behind the control board, which determines the temperature level of air entering into the evaporative coil. If the sensing unit is knocked out of position, the a/c unit might cycle constantly or act unpredictably. The sensing unit should be near the coil but not touching it; change its position by carefully flexing the wire that holds it in place.<p>
