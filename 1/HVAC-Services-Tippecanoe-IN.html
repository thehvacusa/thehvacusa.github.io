Supervisors with BPI certification know that the house is a system and see HVAC equipment as simply one element (out of many) of a comfy environment.<p>
<p>The main factor house owners do not purchase an HVAC service agreement is the cost. They can cost in between $150 and $500 each year, depending on the amount of services provided.
