<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, fairly steady over time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a structure as relatively the same physical material over time. In reality, the real nature of buildings can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research study using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
