<p>As a number of you mentioned, preventative maintenance is needed by all significant equipment producer's to guarantee your factory warranties stay in place. In addition, the concrete outcomes of a PM is typically hard to quantify, as one action mentioned the savings in performance or repairs that were prevented. Many pieces of a furnace or a/c unit don't simply break at the snap of a finger, however rather is the result of recurring use of an element that is out of balance. For instance, a heat exchanger might stop working prematurely due to the fact that the gas pressure was running to high, cooking the metal and causing early wear and tear, resulting in cracks and holes. , if that client had received a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure remains in line and protects the component.. a very useful outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that potentially conserved a client thousands.<p>
