<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional job finding the outside unit as close to the house as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely well-informed of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
