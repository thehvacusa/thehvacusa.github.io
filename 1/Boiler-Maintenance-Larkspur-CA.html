<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned frequently, they can become clogged with debris that can restrict air flow, possibly affecting your comfort and your system's efficiency. Dirty filters can trigger additional wear and tear on furnace parts and in more extreme cases cause the system to shut down totally. By contrast, examining and replacing a furnace filter can generally be performed in simply a few minutes, typically without any tools needed. As a preventative measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, generally installed on the side of the furnace.<p>

<p>Certain immediate effects are similar to those from colds or other viral illness, so it is typically hard to identify if the signs are a result of exposure to indoor air contamination. For this reason, it is very important to take notice of the time and place the signs occur. If the signs fade or disappear when a person is far from the home and return when the person returns, an effort needs to be made to identify indoor air sources that might be possible causes. Some effects might be made worse by an inadequate supply of outside air or from the heating, cooling, or humidity conditions common in the home.<p>
<p>Another alternative to oil furnaces are gas furnaces While oil is generally used in locations where gas lines do not run, there are times when you may have a choice in between the two types. Gas heating systems cost about the same, approximately $6,000 for a high-efficiency system. The genuine advantage of using a gas furnace is the lower cost of heating your house. Heating with gas expenses around $540 a year, instead of the $1,400 a year that it costs to heat with oil.<p>

<p>Geographically, some areas pay consistently higher wages for air conditioning tradesmen. This may be due to high cost of living, remoteness, undesirable climate, or merely a high level of competitors for proficient trades. According to BLS figures, Alaska had the country's greatest typical wages for HVAC specialists at $29.64 per hour or $61,660 per year. The District of Columbia ranked 2nd, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 annually. New Jersey had the third-highest typical wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 annually. Massachusetts and Connecticut rounded out the 5 highest-paying states, at $26.62 and $26.59 per hour or $55,380 and $55,310 annually.<p>
<p>Next, and possibly simply as essential when it concerns central air conditioning costs, is the AC system's size. An unit that is too large will have an easy time keeping the house cool, but will have a harder time removing humidity from the air. On the other hand, a system that is too small will not be able to correctly cool the home on hot days. Thinking about bigger units cost more than smaller sized systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC system your central air system needs to hold.<p>
