"Humidifier fever" is a typical health problem brought on by improper maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and consistent coughs.

Other possible sources of biological contaminants are family pets and household plants.<p>
<p>Some sources, such as developing products, furnishings, and family products like air fresheners, release toxins more or less continuously.
