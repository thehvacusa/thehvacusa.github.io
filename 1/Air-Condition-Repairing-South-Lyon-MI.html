<h3>Signs You May Need an AC Repair Service in South Lyon MI</h3>
<p>The icing issue becomes a lot more serious with lower outdoor temperature levels, so heat pumps are typically set up in tandem with a more conventional type of heating, such as an electrical heating unit, a natural gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is used instead of the heat pump during harsher winter temperatures. In this case, the heatpump is used efficiently throughout the milder temperatures, and the system is switched to the traditional heat source when the outside temperature level is lower.<p>

<p>We called Elite HVACS on one of the most popular days of summertime( we had no central air conditioning for 2weeks) and they sent some1 out very same day to evaluate situation & decided to choose them for the work.
