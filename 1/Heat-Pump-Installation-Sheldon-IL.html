The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and examine. Dripping return ducts can also introduce moisture. Once again, if you believe a mold problem, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>

<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't rewarding you wouldn't use them.
