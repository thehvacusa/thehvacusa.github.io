<p>Specialist heating system setups. However, even the best-maintained heating unit will ultimately fail. HVAC specialists suggest following this basic guideline when deciding whether it's worth investing in a repair: If the system is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost more than half the rate of a new system, it's finest to purchase brand-new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system won't have a lot more years left in it, and it's most likely to be using more energy than necessary.<p>
<p>In a split-system central air conditioner, an outside metal cabinet consists of the condenser and compressor, and an indoor cabinet contains the evaporator. In many split-system air conditioning system, this indoor cabinet likewise consists of a furnace or the indoor part of a heatpump.
