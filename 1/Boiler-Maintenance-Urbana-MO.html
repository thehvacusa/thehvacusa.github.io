<h3>Ductwork Cleaning in Urbana Missouri</h3>
<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" discovered something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this guy belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the home.<p>
<p>When our furnace was passing away, we called 2 local companies for bids. While both were valuable and useful, Ballard Natural Gas offered us a better deal, for exceptional service. Instead of a basic sales job, the owner of the company made a full evaluation of our heating system and situated ways we could have more even heat. He included these significant however minor adjustments in his bid.
