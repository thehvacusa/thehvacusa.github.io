<h3>The Advantages of Buying A New Furnace in Lone Tree CO</h3>
<p>After living in our home for 15 years we figured itâ $ s time to replace the cooling. I proceeded and bought this Carrier and I should state it does the job rather well. It takes very little time to warm up or cool down your house which is one of the important things we didnâ $ t receive from the one we had in the past. The unit hasnâ $ t required any repair work and Iâ $ ve had it for about half a year now.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and educated. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
