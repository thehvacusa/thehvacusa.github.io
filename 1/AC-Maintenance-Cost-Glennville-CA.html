Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
