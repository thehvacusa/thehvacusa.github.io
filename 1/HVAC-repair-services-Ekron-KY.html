<p>If your air conditioning unit is more than 8 years of ages, repair is most likely not worth the expense, unless it's a simple issue like debris obstructing the condenser unit or a worn fan belt. Still, to best weigh your repair-or-replace choice, ask your contractor to evaluate not simply the condition of your existing devices, however also the ducts that provide the cool air and the general quality of the insulation in your home. Improving those components might increase the efficiency of the system as much or more than installing new machinery.<p>
<p>If you have a large house, a house with high ceilings, a home with lots of windows or a home with insufficient insulation, heating your floorings instead of the air might not suffice to reach the level of comfort to which you are accustomed.
