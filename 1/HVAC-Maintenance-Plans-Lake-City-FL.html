<h3>Important Furnace Repair Tips for Your Home in Lake City FL</h3>
<p>Many residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The current trend in house construction is to lower air leakage through cracks and other openings in floorings, roofings, and walls. The mix of these building and construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has resulted in an increase in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside cosmetics air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living areas of residential structures. The ASHRAE guidelines for make-up air for kitchens and bathrooms in houses are much greater. This fresh make-up air waters down indoor contaminants and helps exhaust them from the home.<p>
<p>Four Seasons has installed both of my heating systems and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the yearly maintenance. I have discovered them to be reasonably priced, prompt and do great work. When they installed my main furnace they worked out beyond what was required and redid the entire plenum and the duct work for the water heater due to the fact that the technicians thought they simply didn't appear ideal and they could not leave them that method. No additional charge.<p>

<p>Weatherization generally does not trigger indoor air issues by adding new toxins to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases release contaminants.) However, steps such as installing storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the amount of outside air penetrating into a home. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
