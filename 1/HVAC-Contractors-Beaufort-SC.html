My only unfavorable is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So perhaps a little steep on price for this service, however the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>

<p>When they're shut down and then repowered, ac units and thermostats have integrated hold-up features. The delay can be as long as 10 minutes.
