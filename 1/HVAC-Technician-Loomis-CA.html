<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively steady over time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a building as fairly the same physical product in time. In reality, the real nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as intricate systems. Research study using the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
