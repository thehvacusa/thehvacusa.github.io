However, many of these houses were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this product.

<h3>High Efficiency Furnace in Riverdale ND</h3>
<p>I have actually been using them for several years for my organisations, my own homes and my property customers' homes. I went through 5 other companies prior to I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with different rates and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who explained to me completely the problems which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental home, another occasion. He helped me problem shoot the issue when I called and he advised me to get in touch with service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the unit working once again.

<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
