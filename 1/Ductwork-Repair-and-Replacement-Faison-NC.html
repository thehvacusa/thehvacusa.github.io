<p>Many individuals ignore the extent of the indoor air contamination problem. Air pollution is typically envisioned as the black smoke discharged from factories. Little thought is given to tobacco smoke and the spin-offs of aerosol sprays, cleaners, pesticides, and paints used in the house. To intensify the problem, it is approximated that the average American spends 70 percent to 90 percent of his/her time indoors, and over half that time is spent in the home.<p>
<p>Another alternative to oil heaters are gas furnaces While oil is traditionally utilized in locations where gas lines do not run, there are times when you might have an option in between the two types. Gas heating systems cost about the same, roughly $6,000 for a high-efficiency system. The real advantage of using a gas furnace is the lower cost of heating your home. Heating with gas costs around $540 a year, instead of the $1,400 a year that it costs to heat with oil.<p>

Temporarily increasing ventilation combined with appropriate use of the exhaust system while painting or applying pesticides, for instance, can be beneficial in diluting the concentration of harmful fumes in the air.<p>
