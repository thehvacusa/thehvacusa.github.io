<p>If you set it too low, you're encouraging the growth of mold in moist air. The heat dries the air, preventing mold growth and contamination. Naturally, too-dry air can also aggravate your lungs and sinuses, while too much indoor humidity can add to the development of bacteria and infections, according to a 2018 study in the International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health. The perfect humidity in a house is around 50 percent, according to the American Lung Association.<p>
