Possibly Realtors need to think about a lot of variables to definitively state what a radiant heat system may add to, or subtract from, any offered asking cost. That said, homebuyers aiming to go green," who focus on energy cost savings, or who absolutely want an in-floor heating unit will want to pay a premium for a house that features one.<p>
