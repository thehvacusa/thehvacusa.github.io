<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company because the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>If you have an older central air conditioner, you might choose to change the outside compressor with a modern, high-efficiency system. If you do so, speak with a local heating and cooling contractor to guarantee that the brand-new compressor is correctly matched to the indoor unit. However, thinking about recent changes in refrigerants and air conditioning designs, it might be smarter to change the entire system.<p>
