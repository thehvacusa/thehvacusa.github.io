<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often gets requests for consultation and help in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. During the 1970s, lots of house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation measure. However, much of these homes were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this product. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was installed several years ago are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
