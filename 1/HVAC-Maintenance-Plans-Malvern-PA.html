<p>To state there are a lot of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the ac system back into its initial box, utilizing the dense-foam packaging material to secure it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set package in a cool, dry location for the winter. And if the storeroom has a concrete flooring, location 2 2x4s beneath the box to raise it up and safeguard it from wetness.<p>
<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which houses are built.

Radon gas goes into homes through dirt floors, cracks in concrete walls and floors, floor drains pipes, and sumps. When radon becomes caught in buildings and concentrations build up inside your home, exposure to radon ends up being an issue.<p>
