<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the vehicle debit, although my company does not use vehicle debit lots of companies do so they can have a known amount of cash being available in every month, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do choose to provide vehicle debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There should not be any reason why your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>

<p>All cooling contractors must begin their examination of your home by carrying out a Cooling Contractors of America Handbook J load estimation. This figures out the heat acquire your house goes through. The calculation is reasonably simple to perform and will expose what size unit you need.

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has actually been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Current research studies show that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned products are kept and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can save cash by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical during the pressing and ending up processes. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to decrease your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up, do not accept them till they have been correctly dried. If goods with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent visits, attempt a different dry cleaner.<p>

As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
