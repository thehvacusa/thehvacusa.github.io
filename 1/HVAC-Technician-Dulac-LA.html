<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil modification' kind of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'might' cause a problem in the future. So he said I might swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the very same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>Since an a/c unit moves heat in between the indoor coil and the outside coil, both must be kept clean. This suggests that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is likewise required to regularly clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will eventually lead to damage to the compressor, due to the fact that the condenser coil is accountable for discharging both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat created by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
