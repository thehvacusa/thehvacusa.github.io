<p>My eldest kid always complained about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a new one. For some time I dismissed him but then I recognized that it really didnâ $ t distribute air like it did before. Weâ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didnâ $ t truly think about anything else except replacing it. The one I got deserves every penny. The noise level is itâ and low $ s fantastic on energy conserving too.<p>
