He's stated several times that the special code feature is optional and many, lots of merchants don't utilize it due to the fact that it slows down transactions a lot more due to the back-and-forth communications required. I do not know sufficient about the innovation to know if that is even possible.<p>
<p>If you have a big house, a house with high ceilings, a home with many windows or a house with inadequate insulation, heating your floors rather than the air may not be enough to reach the level of comfort to which you are accustomed.

<p>The primary health result related to exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might present risks, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. Your threat of lung cancer is especially high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
