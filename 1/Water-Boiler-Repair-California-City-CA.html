Leaky return ducts can likewise introduce moisture. Again, if you suspect a mold problem, think about having a service company examine the duct system for leakages.<p>

<h3>Ductwork Repair and Replacement in California City CA</h3>
<p>Ducted heat pump heating & cooling systems act much like standard central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces by means of a duct system. If your house or structure has an existing duct system that is in excellent shape, a ducted heat pump system may be most economical. Utilizing existing ductwork will remove the requirement to install a pricey brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>The cost to repair AC duct work runs between $300 to $500 typically. It's the ductwork that delivers cold air to each room in your house, and if it establishes cracks which leakage, they need to be repaired. Having malfunctioning ductwork makes your system work harder with even worse results. Your home will not be adequately cooled, and your energy costs will go up. Installing new ductwork for the entire home will cost approximately in between $8,900 and $12,300.<p>
