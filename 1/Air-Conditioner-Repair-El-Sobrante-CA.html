<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump become inefficient in more severe cold. This is because ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system need to momentarily change back into the regular air conditioning mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
