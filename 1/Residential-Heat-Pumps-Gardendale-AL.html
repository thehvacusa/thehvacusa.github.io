<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so deal with your contractor to discover a place that's not near a bed room or home-office window. Since it exhausts warm air out the top, do not put the condenser under a deck or completely enclose it. Any airflow constraint will decrease the system's effectiveness. You can, however, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily distribute around it.<p>
<p>Advanced ventilation systems that enable greater airflow from the outdoors, air quality tracking platforms and sensors, and new air purification innovations are ending up being more common as readily available services in commercial and residential HVAC product bundles.
