<p>EER means Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air conditioning units is determined by the variety of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions. As discussed above, a BTU is a traditional system of heat; it is defined as the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit.
