Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to make certain they were no issues besides the blower motor. The only factor he might not set up the brand-new blower motor was because there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the problem is.<p>
<p>Inspect these three things initially if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make certain all the signs up in the house are large open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go clean and outside off the condenser coils (Photo 2).

Deice the A-coil if you have actually altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or up until there's great airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it.
