<h3>Leaking Ductwork in San Bruno California</h3>
<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an additional $30.00. (He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and grumbled) When this guy belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the residential or commercial property.<p>

<h3>Warning Signs That You Need Furnace Repair in San Bruno CA</h3>
<p>The rest of the HVAC system also needs to be in leading condition for the air conditioning unit to work well. This consists of the air handler, evaporator coil, ductwork and registers, all of which live inside the house. The technician can take a look at the ductwork for indications of holes, spaces or extreme dirt if the specific parts are in proper order. Sealing leakages in ductwork can enhance HVAC performance by as much as 30 percent, and offer a cooler home in the hot summertime.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and knowledgeable. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
