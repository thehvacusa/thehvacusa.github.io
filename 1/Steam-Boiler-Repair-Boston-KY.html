<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. As soon as I decided to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the rate great but Mark headed out of his way to tailor a couple of things in my home to make the general air flow more enhanced.

<p>Check these three things first if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the signs up in the house are large open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outdoors and clean off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The lowered air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if numerous signs up were closed or the filter was clogged. Deice the A-coil if you have actually changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or up until there's excellent air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've fixed the problem.<p>
