<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. As soon as I decided to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the price excellent however Mark headed out of his method to customize a few things in my home to make the general air circulation more optimized. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I believe any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
