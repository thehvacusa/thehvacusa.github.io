<h3>Commercial Air Conditioning Repair in Reddick Florida</h3>
<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an additional $30.00. (He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I complained and got a refund) When this man belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the home.<p>
<p>Whatever heating system you set up, it's vital that it's sized properly for your home. Too big and you'll be paying more for equipment and installation than you should. Plus, it will use excessive energy for the quantity of heat you desire produced. If the system is too small, then your house will not be warmed sufficiently and the system will have to continuously run to attempt to heat the entire home, which will increase heating costs.<p>
