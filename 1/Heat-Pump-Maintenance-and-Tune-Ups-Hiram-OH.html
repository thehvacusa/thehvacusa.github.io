<p>Free cooling systems can have really high performances, and are in some cases integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summer cooling. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in because the storage functions as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature level to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
<p>In more complex plans, warm air is allowed to flow and increase out high building openings to the outdoors (stack result ), causing cool outside air to be drawn into low structure openings. Natural ventilation schemes can utilize really little energy, but care needs to be taken to make sure comfort. In humid or warm climates, maintaining thermal comfort exclusively through natural ventilation may not be possible. A/c systems are used, either as backups or supplements. Air-side economizers also use outside air to condition spaces, but do so using fans, ducts, dampers, and control systems to introduce and disperse cool outside air when appropriate.<p>

<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is NECESSARY TO preserve the efficiency and efficiency of your HVAC system, multiple studies through DOE and ACCA can validate this if you're interested. However, choose your contractor wisely, much of the 'reliable' contractors touted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to improper sales strategies that DO make the most of uninformed house owners.

There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Because my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant got here on time. Jose spent time troubleshooting the problem, all the while describing whatever to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working effectively. He needed to go get the appropriate replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose explained the operation and programing to me. I will certainly use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
