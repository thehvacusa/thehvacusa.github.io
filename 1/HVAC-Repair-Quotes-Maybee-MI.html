<p>All heating unit have some level of air purification. From the most basic, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the bigger, 4-inch media filter frequently in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more advanced electronic air cleaners and air purifiers, all require some fundamental maintenance.

<p>As soon as the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high adequate temperature level, a blower fan will begin to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger allows air to be heated up without coming in contact with the actual flame or burner area. Once it reaches an adequate temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the home's duct, supplying warm air to individual bed rooms, living rooms and kitchens through the vents or registers.<p>
