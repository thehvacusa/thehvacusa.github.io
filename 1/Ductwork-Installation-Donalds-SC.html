<p>Frequently, indoor air quality problems in large commercial structures can not be efficiently determined or treated without a detailed structure examination. These examinations may begin with composed questionnaires and telephone consultations in which building investigators evaluate the history of resident symptoms and building operation procedures. Sometimes, these queries might quickly uncover the problem and on-site check outs are unneeded.<p>
<p>A 3rd method to decide whether your home might have poor indoor air quality is to look at your lifestyle and activities. Human activities can be considerable sources of indoor air pollution. Finally, try to find indications of issues with the ventilation in your house. Indications that can suggest your house may not have sufficient ventilation consist of wetness condensation on walls or windows, smelly or stuffy air, dirty central heating and air cooling equipment, and areas where books, shoes, or other products become moldy. To detect odors in your home, action outside for a few minutes, and after that upon reentering your house, note whether smells are obvious.<p>
<p>If you have an older central air conditioner, you may choose to replace the outside compressor with a modern-day, high-efficiency system. If you do so, consult a local heating and cooling contractor to guarantee that the new compressor is properly matched to the indoor unit. Nevertheless, considering recent changes in refrigerants and a/c designs, it might be smarter to change the whole system.<p>
