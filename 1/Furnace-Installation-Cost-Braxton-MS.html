<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a requirement for ac system repair, which you must look out for. First, you need to check your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, however ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
