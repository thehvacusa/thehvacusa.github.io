<p>There are 116 highly-rated local duct cleaners. Indoor contamination sources that release gases or particles into the air are the primary cause of indoor air quality problems in homes. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not bringing in sufficient outdoor air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air pollutants out of the house. Heat and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
<p>Because it's the most typical heating system in Seattle houses, I'll begin with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is delivered to the rooms of your home by means of ducts, and cool air is gathered through cold air return vents. Gas furnaces are ranked for performance. Older units from the 1970s may be ranked 65%, indicating 35% of the heating energy is wasted throughout the combustion process. Today's designs vary from a minimum of 78% up to 98.5%. If your house currently has ducts, changing your heating system with a new, efficient gas furnace is a reasonably simple procedure. Setting up a new gas furnace system can be rather costly if you are adding on to your house or retrofitting a house without ducting.<p>

Rather, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier stays in the room as heat, so the space is really heated up, simply as by an electric heating unit that draws the same amount of power.<p>
