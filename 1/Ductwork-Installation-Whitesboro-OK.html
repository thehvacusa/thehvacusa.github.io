<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so work with your contractor to discover a location that's not near a bed room or home-office window. Don't put the condenser under a deck or completely enclose it because it tires warm air out the top. Any air flow restriction will reduce the system's effectiveness. You can, however, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely circulate around it.<p>
<p>Ask about training and accreditations. A good location to start is the North American Technician Quality (NATE) accreditation. It's sort of a minimum requirement for choosing an HVAC company, but a great deal of contractors out there have not troubled with it! Kick it up a notch by searching for Building Efficiency Institute (BPI) certification. Supervisors with BPI certification know that the home is a system and see HVAC devices as simply one component (out of lots of) of a comfortable environment.<p>
