<p>The primary problem when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones. While setting up a separate split system, workers attempt to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system produces more problems, given that a few of indoor systems can be located far from the exterior. The very first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the cooling separately for each space. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a broad selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional qualities of indoor units operate independently from each other.<p>
