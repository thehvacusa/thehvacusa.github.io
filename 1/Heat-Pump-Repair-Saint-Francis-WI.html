Winter used to be the busy season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summertime, with their generally two-week AC installation wait times swelling to approximately three months. It's been a cultural shift," says Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the climate and the people." And not simply with newcomers more accustomed to AC living. Long time Seattle homeowners are lastly giving in, he states, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit houses with air-cooling systems.<p>

To put it simply, in-floor heating systems offer a different mode and level of comfort. And, as numerous public awareness projects have long reminded us, the more comfy we feel, the more inclined we may be to nudge down our thermostat, in turn lowering our energy expenditures.<p>
