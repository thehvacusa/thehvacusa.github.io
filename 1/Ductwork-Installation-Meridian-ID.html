<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor office, classroom or laboratory environments, rather than industrial or outside settings. In jobs where union subscription is not a concern, an HVAC technician may finish the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system.

It might likewise include the installation of registers where the ductwork connects to specific areas.<p>
<p>The most typical source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which houses are constructed. As uranium naturally breaks down, it releases radon gas which is a colorless, odorless, radioactive gas.
