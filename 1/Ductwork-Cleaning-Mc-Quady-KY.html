<p>The kinds of heating ventilation and a/c (HVAC) systems are as different as the different homes they serve (single family houses, duplexes, mobile homes, apartment or condos, high-rise condos, row real estate, and so on).

<p>Advanced ventilation systems that allow higher airflow from the outdoors, air quality tracking platforms and sensing units, and new air filtration innovations are becoming more typical as available options in residential and commercial HVAC product packages. Adoption of these innovations, however, has not been prevalent, as consumers remain mostly unconcerned to the effects of air quality on health and efficiency.<p>
<p>Weatherization usually does not trigger indoor air problems by including brand-new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases produce toxins.) However, steps such as setting up storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the quantity of outdoor air penetrating into a home. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>What do you do when the company that's providing the service agreement attempts to upsell you every time they pertain to carry out routine maintenance? If the coils were cleaned up in March 2015, why would they be showing "extreme rust" in June 2015 and require a deep cleaning for $400? They sold her a Reme Halo for $1,300, offering her a 10% discount rate if she restored her PMA for seven years, despite the fact that it was 6 months prior to the current one ended. She didn't require a air purification system, but they talked her into it.<p>
