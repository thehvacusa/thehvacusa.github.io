HVAC professionals advise following this standard guideline when deciding whether it deserves buying a repair: If the system is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost more than half the rate of a new system, it's best to buy new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system won't have many more years left in it, and it's likely to be utilizing more energy than required.<p>

Rate ranges do not include any taxes, now or hereafter enacted. Taxes will be included by your Trane Convenience Professional to the prices to comply with federal and local tax law.<p>
