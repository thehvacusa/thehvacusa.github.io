<p>Your full-service HVAC Repair and Installation Company. You can prevent all these issues by ensuring that your system is checked frequently, as this will avoid even small repairs from becoming substantial issues. Attempt to at least clean-up and examine your furnace as frequently as the designer suggests. Likewise, take extreme preventative measures while trying to perform any do-it-yourself repairs to avoid health dangers. While it may be satisfying, fun and even cost-efficient, it is important that you possess some skills prior to attempting to fix these concerns.<p>
<p>A stopped up furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut down. Filthy filters are the most common reason for furnace problems. Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will shut and overheat off too quickly, and your house will not heat up. Replace the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. An unclean filter also triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, decreasing the efficiency of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

<p>Current Evaluation: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and courteous. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
