<p>It is common to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable over time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a structure as fairly unchanged physical material with time. In truth, the real nature of structures can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and understood as complex systems. Research study applying the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
