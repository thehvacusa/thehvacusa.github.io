<p>Typically the most efficient way to enhance indoor air quality is to get rid of specific sources of pollution or to decrease their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas ranges, can be adapted to reduce the quantity of emissions. In most cases, source control is also a more cost-efficient approach to safeguarding indoor air quality than increasing ventilation since increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Particular sources of indoor air contamination in your home are listed later on in this section.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil soaks up heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is flowed back into your house. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface area of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan listed below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is normally routed into a basement floor drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
