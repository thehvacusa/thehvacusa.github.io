This is since the excess heat soaked up from within your house is carried out into the warm water tank instead of being transmitted back into the earth. The outcome, therefore, is free warm water! Moreover, during winter season, the heat from underground can be absorbed to heat domestic water alongside its primary function of providing area heating.
