<p>Radiant heating covers a range of various heating systems, including electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heating systems run on comparable concepts. When it comes to a boiler, the system heats by distributing hot water through a series of pipelines set up in the sub-floor of each room. In the case of electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components. As the hot water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the flooring and into the space.<p>

<h3>Different types of HVAC Repairs in Omaha NE</h3>
<p>Another technique to lowering the concentrations of indoor air pollutants in your home is to increase the amount of outdoor air coming indoors. The majority of house heating and cooling systems, consisting of forced air heating systems, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your home. Opening doors and windows, operating window or attic fans, when the weather allows, or running a window air conditioner with the vent control open increases the outside ventilation rate. Local bathroom or kitchen fans that exhaust outdoors remove contaminants straight from the room where the fan is located and likewise increase the outdoor air ventilation rate.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
