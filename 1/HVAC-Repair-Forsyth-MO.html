<p>Reality: Geothermal systems really take in no water. If an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is returned to that exact same aquifer.

<p>Indoor temperatures are sometimes more challenging to control than they appear due to factors such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperatures ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity ought to be maintained at or listed below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to lower mold growth.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) might not be the most pernicious element affecting indoor air quality, but it is often utilized as a surrogate for air quality and building tenancy level. The more occupants there remain in a space or building, the more CO2 is released into the air. To avoid CO2 levels from increasing expensive-- which can have a negative impact on residents-- outside air needs to be deliberately brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>
