<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser unit using refrigerant piping between an indoor and outdoor  system rather of ducting air directly from the outside unit. Indoor systems with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor units install inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct deal with air from the indoor system to vents or diffusers around the rooms.<p>
