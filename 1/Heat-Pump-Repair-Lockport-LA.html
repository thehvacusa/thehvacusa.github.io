<p>How climate modification affects air quality and direct exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature level (which is a basic mode of operation for contemporary a/c unit) requires that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioning unit increase. This increase has the result that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the ac system eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c unit should increase its power intake by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is triggered, and the a/c unit has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioner's power consumption will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, thus making the 100 W heating component cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
