<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you wouldn't provide them.  Secondly like extended auto guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the essential abilities to do the task and also the morals to treat customers relatively. As a customer you need to be well notified in order not to be entirely benefited from. A lot of companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Finally found someone to properly service and the system has been running problem totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

Our team is all set to come to your house, identify what you need, and help you discover a furnace that fits within your budget. We know this is an important choice, so we'll help you make the best one.<p>
<p>I am changing our High Velocity System since of a severe refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be using the above noted equipment, a Carrier, Convenience Series Single Phase Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are also installing an Unico single Stage Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER.

They will likewise reuse the refrigerant lines and leave the R-11 refrigerant and replace with a R410 refrigerant. They will likewise set up a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat.
