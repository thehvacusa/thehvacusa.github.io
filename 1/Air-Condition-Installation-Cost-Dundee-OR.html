<p>If you observe a decline in heat output, first ensure the air filter is clean and in great condition. Next, check other parts of the furnace for any build-up of dust, debris and dirt, an affordable fix that can help enhance efficiency. Also, inspect the vents and ducts for obstruction. Lastly, make certain the thermostat is working and located correctly. Try moving it far from direct sunlight considering that this might impact temperature level readings on the thermostat and trigger it to misread the temperature level in your house. If this happens, your thermostat will shut down the furnace prematurely and leave your house feeling cold. You may also need to check your insulation to make certain that warm air does not escape from your area through numerous openings.<p>
