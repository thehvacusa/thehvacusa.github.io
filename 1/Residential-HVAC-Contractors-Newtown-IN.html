<p>Aside from area heating, the geothermal heater can also be linked to a device called a geothermal desuperheater. The geothermal desuperheater can recycle the excess heat created from the ground source heatpump compressor and uses it to heat water.

<p>Consider potential impacts of indoor air contamination if you utilize an unvented kerosene or gas area heating system. Follow the producer's instructions, particularly guidelines on the appropriate fuel and keeping the heater effectively changed.
