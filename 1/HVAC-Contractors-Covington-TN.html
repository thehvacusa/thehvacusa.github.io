<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a requirement for a/c repair, which you need to look out for. Initially, you ought to examine your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
