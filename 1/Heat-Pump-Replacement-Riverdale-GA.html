<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (most of the times) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is currently GFCI protected like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad need to be GFCI protected.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and problem circuit breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we chose to set up a dedicated circuit with its own circuitry and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are readily available.<p>
<p>Additionally, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why spaces heated up by radiators are vulnerable to cold areas", suggesting that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and extremely hot next to the radiators. This normally results in opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go again, letting all that energy paid to heat up your home escape out of the window. Radiant heat supplies warmth from the flooring up throughout the room with no cold areas or stuffiness in the area being warmed.<p>
