<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (most of the times) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is currently GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad should be GFCI safeguarded.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and nuisance circuit breaker trips.
