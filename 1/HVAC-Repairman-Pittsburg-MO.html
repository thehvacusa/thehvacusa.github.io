<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 professionals I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
