<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
