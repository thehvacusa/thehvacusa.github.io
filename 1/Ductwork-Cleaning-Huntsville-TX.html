<p>Air ducts are accountable for distributing hot and cold air throughout your house, providing a comfortable environment in every space. However ducts that are not set up properly or maintained can disperse pollutants from one space to another.

<p>The primary health impact connected with exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might pose threats, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Significant health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. Your danger of lung cancer is specifically high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
