<p>When your Volvo no longer keeps you cool- give All Vovo a call! Heat pumps work extremely well in temperate environments like King and South Snohomish counties. Working on electricity, a heatpump is a cost-efficient option using a refrigeration cycle like that which cools your fridge, but in reverse. Instead of warming or cooling the air currently inside your home, it draws heat or cool from the air outside and pushes it through the ventilation system of your house.<p>
<p>In 1995, Germany made CFC fridges unlawful. 30 DuPont and other companies blocked the refrigerant in the U.S. with the U.S. EPA, disparaging the technique as "that German technology". 29 31 Nevertheless, in 2004, Greenpeace worked with multinational corporations like Coca-Cola and Unilever, and later on Pepsico and others, to develop a corporate union called Refrigerants Naturally!. 30 32 Then, four years later, Ben & Jerry's of Unilever and General Electric began to take actions to support production and use in the U.S. 33 In 2011 the EPA decided in favor of the ozone- and climate-safe refrigerant for U.S. manufacture. 25 34 35 HFCs like R-134a, r-404a and r-410a are, as of 2020, being changed with HFO and hydrocarbon refrigerants like R-1234ze in chillers for commercial refigeration and a/c, R-1234yf in vehicles, R-32 in residential a/c and CO2 (R-744) in commercial refrigeration. R-600 (isobutane) is currently commonly utilized in residential refrigeration.<p>
