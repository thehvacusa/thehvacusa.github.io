Because they don't require any brand-new ductwork to be installed, ductless heat pumps are terrific for additions. Due to the fact that an unit is set up in each space or area you want to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature level of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensors that immediately raise the temperature in the room when you exist.<p>
