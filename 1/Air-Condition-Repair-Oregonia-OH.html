<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively stable over time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a structure as reasonably the same physical product in time. In reality, the true nature of structures can be considered as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and understood as complex systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
