<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Radiant heat systems have actually been around since the days of the Romans when they laid a network of pipes under their marble floors and connected them into a warm water supply. Romans used a wood-fired boiler tended by servants and an elementary pumping device to distribute warm water that warmed their stone floorings. In turn, the uniformity of the floor heat moved heat to other short articles in the rooms, including the human residents.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to complete. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. As soon as I decided to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the cost terrific however Mark headed out of his method to tailor a few things in my home to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I believe any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

An F" for $616 in labor costs (thaw control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were noted on the invoice prior to work began. Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax included another $53. The work was completed in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
