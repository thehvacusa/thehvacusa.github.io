<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Just take a photo of the wires before detaching anything (you might need a referral later). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp ports need to snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Protect the brand-new capacitor (Picture 5) when you've swapped all the wires.<p>

A few of these styles include energy-efficient heat recovery ventilators (also known as air-to-air heat exchangers).
