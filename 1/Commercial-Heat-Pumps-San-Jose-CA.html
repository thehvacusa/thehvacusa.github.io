<p>Another option to oil furnaces are gas furnaces While oil is traditionally used in locations where gas lines do not run, there are times when you might have an option between the 2 types. Gas heating systems cost about the same, approximately $6,000 for a high-efficiency unit. The genuine benefit of utilizing a gas furnace is the lower cost of heating your house.
