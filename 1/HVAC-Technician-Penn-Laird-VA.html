<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment typically lasts years, considering that it is safeguarded indoors. When it does need to be replaced, the expense is much less than putting in a whole brand-new geothermal system, because the loop or well is the most costly to set up. New technical standards remove the problem of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some incorrectly sized systems did overcool the ground or get too hot with time, to the point that the system no longer had sufficient of a temperature gradient to work.<p>
<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your automobile's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation.

When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine might damage the engine elements. To prevent this from happening, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator needs handled by specialists, see Eric's Garage today.<p>
