A/c help to dehumidify the incoming air, but in incredibly damp climates or in cases where the ac system is large, it may not achieve a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and since the air conditioning unit will need more energy to cool your house. A preferable option is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be included as a retrofit to most existing systems.<p>
