<p>SysTech Design specializes in commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for improving and keeping the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The very same is true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your house. Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to adhere to and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils guarantees dirt doesn't develop and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from building up on and below the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 entered force in 2000 and prohibited using ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Regulation prohibited using R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This suggests that equipment that utilizes R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now banned, units that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and preserved.<p>
