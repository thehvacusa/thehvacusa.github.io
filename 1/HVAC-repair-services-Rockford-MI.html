Not just was the price fantastic but Mark went out of his method to tailor a few things in my home to make the total air flow more enhanced. I think it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning assistance figure out the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications result from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation.
