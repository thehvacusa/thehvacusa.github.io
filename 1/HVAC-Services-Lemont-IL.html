If you've set up the parts shown and reinstalled the detach block, repowered the breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and reduced the temperature listed below the indoor temperature, and the system doesn't fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
