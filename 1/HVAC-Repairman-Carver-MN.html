<p>Free cooling systems can have really high efficiencies, and are often integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer season cooling. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in since the storage functions as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
