<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned up frequently, they can end up being obstructed with particles that can restrict air flow, possibly impacting your convenience and your system's performance. Filthy filters can trigger additional wear and tear on furnace elements and in more severe cases trigger the system to shut down completely. By contrast, changing a furnace and checking filter can usually be done in simply a couple of minutes, frequently with no tools required. As a precaution, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, usually installed on the side of the furnace.<p>

<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high effectiveness, and are in some cases integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in since the storage serves as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, causing the temperature to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
