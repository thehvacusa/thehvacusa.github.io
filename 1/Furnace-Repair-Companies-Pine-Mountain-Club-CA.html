<p>Heating is the largest energy cost in the typical home. In really dry environments, evaporative coolers, often described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during heat.

The reasonable heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature of the incoming air is minimized, but it is also more damp, so the total heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. Some of the reasonable heat of the entering air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The outcomes can be rather considerable if the entering air is dry enough.<p>
