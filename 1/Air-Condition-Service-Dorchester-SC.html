<h3>How To Pick An HVAC Company in Dorchester SC</h3>
<p>When you and your household walk into your home in Sacramento, CA, are you as comfy as you can be? Do you find it to be either too cold during the winter or too warm in locations during the summer? Whether you're having an issue with unequal cooling or heating, or your indoor air quality isn't up to par, Sierra Pacific House & Comfort, Inc. has the services and products you require.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
