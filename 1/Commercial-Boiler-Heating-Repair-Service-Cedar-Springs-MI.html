He understood simply what the problem was and repaired it really rapidly. However here is the very best ONE. About ten years ago my whole cooling and gas heat went absolutely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
