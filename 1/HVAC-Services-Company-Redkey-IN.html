<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly receives ask for assessment and assistance in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. During the 1970s, lots of house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation step. Nevertheless, a lot of these houses were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this product. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was set up several years earlier are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>A clogged up furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut off. Unclean filters are the most common reason for furnace problems. Dust and dirt restrict airflow-- and if the filter gets too clogged, the heat exchanger will shut and overheat off too rapidly, and your house won't heat up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, change the filter. An unclean filter also causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, minimizing the efficiency of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
