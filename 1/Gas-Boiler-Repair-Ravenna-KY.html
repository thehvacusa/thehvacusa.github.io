Some sources, such as building products, home furnishings and items like air fresheners, can launch contaminants basically constantly. Other sources, related to activities like cigarette smoking, cleaning, redecorating or doing hobblies launch pollutants intermittently. Unvented or malfunctioning devices or improperly used products can launch higher and in some cases hazardous levels of contaminants inside.<p>
<p>The very first ac system and refrigerators used flammable or hazardous gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or lp, that might result in deadly mishaps when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. developed the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number suggesting the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most utilized in direct-expansion house and structure convenience cooling is an HCFC referred to as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
