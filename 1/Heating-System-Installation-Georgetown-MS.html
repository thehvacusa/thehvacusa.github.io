<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional job locating the outside unit as near the house as possible per my demand. The job took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely well-informed of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil change' kind of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'could' trigger an issue in the future. So he said I might swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
