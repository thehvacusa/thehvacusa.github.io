<p>There are some varieties of mold which contain poisonous compounds (mycotoxins). Nevertheless, exposure to dangerous levels of mycotoxin via inhalation is not possible for the most part, as toxins are produced by the fungal body and are not at considerable levels in the launched spores.

More major than most allergenic homes is the capability of mold to activate episodes in persons that already have asthma, a severe respiratory disease.<p>
<p>Fantastic Item! Shipment was kind of odd being that the box was opened and products might have fell out. However after review of contents we guaranteed it was all intact. The item was extremely lite weight and takes some time to use. Keep in mind: purchase advised non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and needed to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Make sure to watch the video initially prior to installation and follow all directions exactly. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had problems with air bubble pockets. After getting in touch with support, we solved problems. I would recommend this item to anyone who's remodeling or installing their bathroom for the first time. Adding in a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>
