<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may think. Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive versatile pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to tear and wear and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>. Prior to picking the installation area of ac system, a number of primary factors need to be considered. First off, the direction of air flow from the indoor units should not fall on the place of rest or workspace. Secondly, there need to not be any obstacles on the way of the airflow that might avoid it from covering the area of the premises as much as possible. The outdoor system needs to also be found in an open space, otherwise the heat from your house will not be successfully released outside and the productivity of the whole system will drop dramatically. It is extremely suggested to set up the ac system systems in quickly accessible places, for additional maintenance throughout operation.<p>
