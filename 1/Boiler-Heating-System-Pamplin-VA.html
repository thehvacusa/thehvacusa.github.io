<p>Heating systems are like cars. As they age, you can change one part only need another part replaced or fixed next year. It does not take long to invest $500 simply to keep an old oil or gas furnace running. Furnaces sustain the most breakdowns in the last 2 years of their lives. Another repair sign is whether you had to wait to get parts replaced. As a furnace ages, it gets harder to source replacement parts. Waiting that can be really cold on a below zero night.<p>

This makes geothermal heating a readily available and trusted  source of energy.<p>

<p>When the heat pump went out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was very helpful in gathering information on the phone and offering clear directions about how to temporarily manage the issue and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely effective and provided clear communication about the issue, its treatments, and its future avoidance. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was professional and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will definitely utilize Stability Energy Systems again, for office and home.<p>
