I went through five other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with different rates and various problems that didn't make any sense.

<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and after that determine the height and width of the opening. Be sure to have those dimensions on hand when looking for an ac system to guarantee it'll fit comfortably into the window. Also, keep fire security in mind when choosing where to set up the air conditioning system: Do not place it in an egress window that acts as the only methods of escape should a fire erupt.<p>
<p>Inadequate maintenance of the HVAC system also may add to indoor air quality problems. Ventilation system filters that are not changed regularly might become stopped up, decreasing air circulation volume, distribution, and quality.
