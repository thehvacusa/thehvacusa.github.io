<p>A packaged unit, usually set up on the roofing, is most commonly used on commercial structures, but it is also a choice for property owners to consider. Often times, these systems contain not only the air conditioning unit itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this unit is surely the cost. Packaged systems are great for those looking to conserve cash on the installation of a new heating and cooling system individually, considering that the system is combined. Nevertheless, one con is that these systems are generally only available for larger houses due to their high power and capability. Additionally, while they can be a great way to conserve cash on a complete HVAC system, they're still significantly more pricey than purchasing simply a cooling system. Therefore, this may not be the very best choice for homeowners searching for short-term savings or those with smaller budget plans.<p>
