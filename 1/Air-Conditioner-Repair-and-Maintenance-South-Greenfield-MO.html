<p>Have utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. When I have concerns, they provide me concern and a lower rate. Bought a new primary system and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase prolonged warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Great investment in my opinion. Never try to offer me something I don't require.<p>
