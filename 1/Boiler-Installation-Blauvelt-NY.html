Initially, you ought to examine your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly.<p>
