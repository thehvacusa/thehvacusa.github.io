<h3>Boiler Repair and Water Boiler Issues in Richland NJ</h3>
<p>When temps outside start to heat up, you rely on your air conditioner to cool you cool. But in order to keep a comfy indoor environment, you require every component of your air conditioning system to be working its best.

<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is normally a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without airflow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
