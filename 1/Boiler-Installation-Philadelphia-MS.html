<p>EER represents Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air units is measured by the variety of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set variety of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a standard unit of heat; it is specified as the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit.

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your cars and truck's internal combustion engine.

A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine could damage the engine parts. To prevent this from taking place, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator requires managed by specialists, see Eric's Garage today.<p>
