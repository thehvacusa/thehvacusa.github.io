<h3>Advantages of Pre-Insulated Duct Systems in Bernville PA</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser system using refrigerant piping between a outside and indoor unit instead of ducting air straight from the outdoor unit. Indoor units with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor systems mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct handle air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>4 Seasons has set up both of my heaters and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the annual maintenance. I have discovered them to be reasonably priced, prompt and do great work. When they installed my primary furnace they worked out beyond what was needed and redid the entire plenum and the duct work for the hot water heater since the technicians thought they just didn't seem right and they could not leave them that method. No extra charge.<p>
