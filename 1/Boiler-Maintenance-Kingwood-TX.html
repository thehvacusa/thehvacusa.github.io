<p>Because it has to run longer than a correctly sized system, an undersize system won't be able to cool rooms down completely on the most popular days and will cost more to run. An oversize compressor also costs more to operate due to the fact that it just takes more electrical energy to run a larger unit. And an oversize unit does not lower humidity efficiently. That's since it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off before it has a chance to distribute the correct volume of air past the coils to draw out the needed moisture. The outcome is a room that does not seem as cool as the temperature suggests. In truth, the room can feel damp and clammy.<p>
