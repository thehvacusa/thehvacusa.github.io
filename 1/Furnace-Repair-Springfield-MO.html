<h3>HVAC Duct Cleaning in Springfield MO</h3>

Using existing ductwork will eliminate the need to install an expensive new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

The heat exchanger enables air to be warmed without coming in contact with the actual flame or burner area.
