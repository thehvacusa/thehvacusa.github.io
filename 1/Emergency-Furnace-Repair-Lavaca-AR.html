<p>You're motivating the development of mold in damp air if you set it too low. The heat dries out the air, avoiding mold growth and contamination. Obviously, too-dry air can also aggravate your sinuses and lungs, while excessive indoor humidity can contribute to the development of bacteria and infections, according to a 2018 study in the International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health. The ideal humidity in a home is around 50 percent, according to the American Lung Association.<p>
