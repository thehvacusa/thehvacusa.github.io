<p>How environment modification affects air quality and direct exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature level (which is a standard modus operandi for modern air conditioning unit) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the a/c unit increase. This increase has the result that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioner removes that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning unit need to increase its power intake by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of performance) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is activated, and the air conditioning system has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioning unit's power intake will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, therefore making the 100 W heating component cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
<p>HVAC Systems Can Add To Air Quality Issues. HVAC systems can also exacerbate indoor air quality problems.
