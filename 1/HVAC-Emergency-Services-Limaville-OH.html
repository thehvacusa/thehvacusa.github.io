<p>Bear in mind that the SEER rating is calculated using the very same set of temperature levels throughout the board. The typical summertime temperature to arrive at the SEER rating is 83 degrees, so to reach the correct SEER score for your location, subtract 2 points for every 10 degrees over 83. The minimum SEER rating has to be at least 13 for all new cooling systems made in the United States.<p>
<p>G&S did an outstanding task installing our brand-new furnace and AC system. The best aspect of G&S is that they warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace failed within a number of months (no fault of G&S). Producers service warranty would cover the parts cost but G&S fixed and covered labor cost under their warranty. Likewise they detected the problem and repaired really quickly. Certainly A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>PE companies tend to operate with the goal of selling or spinning off a firm at some point. This might be through a public offering, a sale to a big service in the field, or even a sale to another PE firm. CoolSys is an HVAC contractor owned by PE company Ares Management. Ares bought CoolSys from Audex, another PE firm, earlier this year. Audex had owned CoolSys for 3 years before that.<p>

You will also enjoy a a lot more flexible system in regards to installation and cost. And because each indoor system has its own thermostat, you can say goodbye to thermostat warfare when a single person would choose it a little warmer in a various room.<p>
