<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to end up. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. When I chose to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the rate terrific however Mark headed out of his method to tailor a couple of things in my home to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>As a lot of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is needed by all major devices manufacturer's to guarantee your factory guarantees remain in place. In addition, the tangible results of a PM is typically difficult to measure, as one action mentioned the cost savings in effectiveness or repairs that were avoided. Most pieces of a furnace or air conditioner do not simply break at the snap of a finger, but rather is the result of recurring use of an element that is out of balance. For example, a heat exchanger may fail too soon since the gas pressure was operating to high, cooking the metal and triggering early wear and tear, leading to holes and cracks. , if that customer had actually gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and secures the component.. an extremely advantageous outcome and one that was no charge at the time of service, but one that potentially conserved a client thousands.<p>
