<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a requirement for ac system repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. Initially, you should check your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
