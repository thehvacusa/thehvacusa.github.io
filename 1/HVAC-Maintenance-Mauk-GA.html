<p>There is no easy response, however numerous use the rule of thumb that if a repair adds up to around 50% of the cost of a brand-new furnace, replacing is probably a much better option.

<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you must keep an eye out for. First, you ought to inspect your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if totally iced over.<p>
