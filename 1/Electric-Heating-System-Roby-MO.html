<p>The term radiant heat covers a number of different system types. Most typical are boilers, which are termed hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are frequently referred to as simply glowing systems. Electric radiant heat systems have heating components installed in the subfloor of each space in the house, periodically connected to terminal units like baseboard heating systems. When the system remains in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating aspects throughout your house. Heat radiates out from the heating components, through the flooring, and into the space. This is why the method is referred to as radiant heating.<p>
