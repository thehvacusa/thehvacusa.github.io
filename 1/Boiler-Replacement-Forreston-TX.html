The fluid circulates around this loop, transferring the soaked up heat to a refrigerant via the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it travels through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct result of the compression procedure. From here, the gas transfers to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heater.<p>
