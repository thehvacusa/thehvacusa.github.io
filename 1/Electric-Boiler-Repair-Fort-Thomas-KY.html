<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality models, specifically the CONTAM series which predicts airflows and impurity concentrations in multizone building systems. CONTAM is based on a graphic interface that allows the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and utilize "icons" to represent air flow courses, ventilation system parts, and pollutant sources. CONTAM has been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transportation in large residential, office, and school buildings.<p>

Atmospheric pressure differences developed by these forces move air-borne pollutants from locations of higher pressure to locations of lower pressure through any readily available opening in building walls, ceilings, floors, doors, windows, and HVAC systems. Even if the opening is little, air will move until the inside pressure amounts to the outside.<p>

<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to vaporize, for this reason the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator.
