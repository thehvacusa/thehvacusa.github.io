Load calculating is referred to as the Handbook J calculation and need to be carried out by the HVAC contractor prior to providing an installation or system cost for cooling. If your contractor says they understand the size of air conditioning unit you require based on experience or on square footage alone, transfer to another contractor.

When the air conditioner works however your home doesn't cool, the issue is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
