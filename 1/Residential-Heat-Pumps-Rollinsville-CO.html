<p>Free cooling systems can have very high performances, and are in some cases integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer a/c. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in due to the fact that the storage serves as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, triggering the temperature to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
