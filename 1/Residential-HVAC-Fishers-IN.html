<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear and are at the top of the list of typical a/c service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to replace it every five years approximately. Loosen the old AC contactor before getting rid of the wires. Then move the wires to the new system (Picture 6).<p>

<p>When the heatpump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Stability was very handy in gathering details on the phone and supplying clear directions about how to momentarily handle the problem and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely efficient and offered clear interaction about the problem, its remedies, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was professional and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will certainly use Integrity Energy Systems once again, for office and home.<p>
<p>I am really amazed with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call service several years earlier and know the importance of having the best parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also amazed that he appeared at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be using Waycoff's again, and would advise them to everybody. Thank You quite.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil takes in heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is flowed back into your house. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface area of the evaporator coil as liquid water, leaking into a pan listed below. From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is normally routed into a basement floor drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
