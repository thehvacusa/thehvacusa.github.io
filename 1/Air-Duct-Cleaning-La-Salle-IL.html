<p>All houses require reliable ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot light has been burnt out from usage. Another possible reason might be a damaged thermostat, avoiding the furnace from adjusting to the proper temperature. Furnaces that kick on regularly may be due to an unclean filter, which is not permitting the furnace to cycle air appropriately. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it turns on or is humming, there may be an internal issue. While humming is caused by a slipped belt in the internal functions, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled and even an unclean burner.<p>

<h3>AC Maintenance Cost in La Salle Illinois</h3>

<p>Reinstall the access panel and disconnect block. Switch on the circuit breaker and furnace switch.

The fan motor is most likely shot if the compressor starts but the fan does not. Shut off the power and remove the screws around the condenser cover. Raise the cover and get rid of the fan blade and motor (Image 7). Re-install the blade and secure the cover. Then repower the unit and see if the fan starts. If  it doesn't, you have actually given it your best shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>
