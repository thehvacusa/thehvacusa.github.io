<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding job locating the outdoor unit as near to your house as possible per my request. The job took 2 days and my yard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely knowledgeable of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>When the heat pump headed out in our offices, Taylor at Stability was very handy in gathering information on the phone and providing clear instructions about how to briefly deal with the issue and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely effective and offered clear communication about the issue, its solutions, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will definitely use Integrity Energy Systems again, for office and house.<p>
