<p>We tend to think of air pollution as something outdoors - ozone, haze, or smog hanging in the air, especially in summer. These convection heaters are still widely used and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or gas, however some are electrically powered also.<p>
<p>The life-span of a central air system is thought about to be 15-20 years, and today's air conditioning unit are more energy efficient than designs made 5 years ago, so it makes financial sense to change or upgrade your unit if it's 5 years old or older. The best central air conditioner you can buy today will use 30-50% less energy than one bought in 1975 while providing the same amount of cooling.<p>
