<p>Ducted heatpump cooling and heating systems act much like standard central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas via a duct system. If your home or building has an existing duct system that is in great shape, a ducted heat pump system may be most inexpensive. Using existing ductwork will get rid of the need to set up an expensive new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>Air conditioning can also be supplied by a process called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is included because the temperature of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, consequently declining its effectiveness.<p>
