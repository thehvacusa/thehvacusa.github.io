<p>Fact: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment usually lasts decades, since it is safeguarded inside your home. When it does need to be replaced, the cost is much less than putting in an entire new geothermal system, considering that the loop or well is the most pricey to install. New technical guidelines eliminate the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some improperly sized systems did get too hot or overcool the ground with time, to the point that the system no longer had sufficient of a temperature level gradient to operate.<p>

<p>Biological impurities include germs, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these contaminants. Pollens originate from plants; infections are sent by individuals and animals; germs are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and household animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent irritant. When it dries, it can end up being air-borne. Contaminated central air handling systems can become breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then disperse these impurities through the home.<p>
