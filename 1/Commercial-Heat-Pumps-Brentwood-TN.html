For example, he may seal gaps and cracks in the external walls and attic flooring, or he may blow insulation into the walls, either of which could knock as much as 30% off your heating & cooling costs. Insulation might be a more effective option to your cooling issues than changing your devices.<p>
<p>Occupational direct exposure limits utilize dose-response information which reveal the health impacts of repeated exposure to one particular chemical. Comparable data is not offered for long-term, low-level exposures to a combination of impurities as is the case for IAQ issues. Currently, there is not enough info readily available to anticipate the impacts of exposure to a number of possibly harmful agents at the same time.<p>
