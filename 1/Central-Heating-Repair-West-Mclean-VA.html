<p>Your ventilation, heating, and air conditioning system (HVAC) function as a collection source for a range of impurities that have the potential to negatively affect your health-- pollutants such as mold, fungis, germs, and really small particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor must evaluate and, if needed, update the building envelope. For instance, he may seal gaps and cracks in the outer walls and attic flooring, or he may blow insulation into the walls, either of which might knock as much as 30% off your heating and cooling costs. Insulation might be a more efficient solution to your cooling problems than changing your equipment.<p>
