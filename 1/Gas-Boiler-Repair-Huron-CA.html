Numerous common building materials used before 1975 consist of asbestos, such as some flooring tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heating unit, pipe wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation materials. Normally, considerable releases of asbestos fiber do not happen unless the building materials are disturbed, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or structure remodelling. Due to the fact that the fibers can be spread out into the air throughout the removal process, removal of asbestos-containing products is not always ideal. A management program for undamaged asbestos-containing products is typically advised instead.<p>
<p>A clogged up furnace filter can cause a furnace to turn off. Dirty filters are the most common reason for furnace problems. Dust and dirt limit airflow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too quickly, and your house won't warm up.
