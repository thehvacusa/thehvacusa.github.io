In jobs where union subscription is not an issue, an HVAC technician might finish the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This includes cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, attaching the ducts to the HVAC system, and installing the ductwork in the structure. It may likewise include the installation of signs up where the ductwork connects to private spaces.<p>
