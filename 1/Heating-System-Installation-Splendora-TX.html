<p>There are lots of actions a house owner can require to choose products that will avoid indoor air problems from taking place - a number of them are discussed here. Initially, use exterior-grade pushed wood items made with phenol-formaldehyde resin in floors, kitchen cabinetry, and wall surface areas. Or, as an alternative, consider using solid wood products. Second of all, if you prepare to set up wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, particularly concrete in basements, ensure that an effective moisture barrier is set up prior to setting up the carpet. Do temporarily adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be gotten rid of if it ends up being damp.<p>
