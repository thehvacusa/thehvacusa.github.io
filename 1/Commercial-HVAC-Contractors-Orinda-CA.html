<h3>Boiler Maintenance in Orinda CA</h3>
<p>Lead has long been recognized as a harmful toxic waste. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human being Services called lead the " primary environmental threat to the health of kids in the United States." There are lots of methods which people are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, contaminated soil, degrading paint, and dust. When a private breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has settled, Airborne lead enters the body.

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has actually been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Recent studies show that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned items are saved and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can save cash by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical during the pushing and completing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to reduce your exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical smell when you select them up, do not accept them up until they have actually been effectively dried. Attempt a different dry cleaner if items with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent sees.<p>

Allergens found in indoor air are mainly biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect pest particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold. All of these products are little particles, can become air-borne, and hence, are easily inhaled. Allergens that are inhaled by sensitized people with asthma can trigger asthma attacks. For instance, if you think of a group of individuals with asthma, the presence of feline irritant might bring on an asthma attack in individuals with feline allergic reactions, however not in those people who do not have cat allergic reactions.<p>
<p>Also, there are natural causes for indoor air pollution.
