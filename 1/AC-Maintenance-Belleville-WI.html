Pushed wood products made for indoor use include: particleboard (utilized as subflooring and shelving and in cabinetry and furniture); wood plywood paneling (used for decorative wall covering and utilized in cabinets and furniture); and medium density fiberboard (used for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furniture tops).

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system must momentarily switch back into the routine air conditioning mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
