<p>If you suspect a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of visible development or a moldy odor regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold begins with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and maintain. Leaking return ducts can also introduce wetness. Again, if you presume a mold problem, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>

The circuit boards collaborate the operation and manage of the motors, sensing units, ignitor, gas valve and more. DIY repair is possible, but the brand-new control panel must be set up precisely right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work.
