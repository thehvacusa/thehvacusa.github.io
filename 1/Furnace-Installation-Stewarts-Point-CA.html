<p>Remember, too, that you may wish to speak to a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heat pump units can have various heating and cooling capabilities. You may look for a heat pump more tailored towards cooling capacity and efficiency if you already have a home heating system. For a higher-end design to take care of your heating and cooling requirements, you'll naturally want to search for a design that will have sufficient heating for the cold Seattle winter seasons. Fortunately is that the one significant downside of heat pumps is that they can fail in the exceptionally hot or cold temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound location.<p>
<p>Think about prospective effects of indoor air pollution if you use an unvented kerosene or gas space heating unit. Follow the manufacturer's instructions, especially directions on the proper fuel and keeping the heating unit appropriately adjusted. A persistent yellow-tipped flame is generally an indication of maladjustment and increased pollutant emissions. While a space heating system is in use, open a door from the room where the heating system is located to the rest of the house and open a window slightly.<p>
