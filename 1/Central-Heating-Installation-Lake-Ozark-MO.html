<p>Recent Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was educated and respectful. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
