<p>Current Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and educated. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
