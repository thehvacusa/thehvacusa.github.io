<p>Air conditioning can also be provided by a procedure called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added since the temperature of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, thus declining its efficiency.<p>
