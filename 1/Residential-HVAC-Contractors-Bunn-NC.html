Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts.

<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was quick and very clear about his examination, ensuring I comprehended what was kept an eye out.

So possibly a little steep on price for this service, but the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
