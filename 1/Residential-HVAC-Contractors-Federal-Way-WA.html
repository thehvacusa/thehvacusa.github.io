<p>If you suspect a mold issue-- either since of visible development or a musty odor consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold starts with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and inspect. Dripping return ducts can also introduce wetness. Again, if you think a mold problem, consider having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>
