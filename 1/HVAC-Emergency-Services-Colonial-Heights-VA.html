<p>It prevails to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively stable in time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a building as relatively the same physical product in time.

Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
