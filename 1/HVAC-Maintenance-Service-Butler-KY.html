<p>Customer items which contain methylene chloride include paint strippers, adhesive cleaners, and aerosol spray paints. Methylene chloride is known to trigger cancer in animals. Also, methylene chloride is transformed to carbon monoxide gas in the body and can trigger symptoms related to direct exposure to carbon monoxide gas.

<p>The cost to repair AC duct runs between $300 to $500 usually. It's the ductwork that provides cold air to each space in your home, and if it develops fractures which leakage, they need to be fixed. Having malfunctioning ductwork makes your system work harder with even worse outcomes. Your home will not be adequately cooled, and your energy bills will go up. Installing brand-new ductwork for the whole house will cost approximately between $8,900 and $12,300.<p>
<p>Weatherization typically does not cause indoor air issues by including brand-new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes produce pollutants.) However, procedures such as installing storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the amount of outdoor air infiltrating into a house. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working throughout times of high humidity, when there is not much dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for home occupants. Unlike other kinds of air conditioning system, evaporative coolers rely on the outdoors air to be transported through cooler pads that cool the air prior to it reaches the within a house through its air duct system; this cooled outside air needs to be allowed to push the warmer air within your home out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically easy to maintain and comprehend.<p>
