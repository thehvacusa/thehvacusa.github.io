In addition, some exposures, such as asbestos and radon, do not trigger immediate signs but can lead to cancer after several years.<p>
<p>The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill is dedicated to providing a workplace that is free of recognized threats and to examination grievances that may be related to bad indoor air quality (IAQ). Though particular regulations have not been established for IAQ in the work location, the Environment, Health and Safety Department (EHS) considers suggestions from the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA), and the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and A/c Engineers (ASHRAE).<p>

However, given that all elements of the dehumidifier remain in the same room, no heat energy is eliminated. Rather, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the space is in fact warmed, simply as by an electric heater that draws the same amount of power.<p>

Opportunities are there will be mold growing nearby if a source of water or condensation can be discovered. Repair the moisture problem, either by locating the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Completely clean the location using established health department suggestions.<p>
