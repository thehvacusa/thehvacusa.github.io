<p>Central air conditioning units are determined in heaps. This measurement is based on the system's capability to cool your house. For instance, a 1 ton system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in heaps, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This means a 4.5 lot system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it indicates the quantity of energy required to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F Â°.<p>
<p>Furthermore, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why rooms heated by radiators are vulnerable to cold areas", indicating that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and extremely hot next to the radiators.
