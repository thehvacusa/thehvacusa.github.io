<p>Instantaneous discounts on high-efficiency heat pump technologies are readily available to equipment installers, applied at the wholesaler or supplier point-of-purchase. Gas furnace not blowing hot air? Simply as with switches, someone may have shut off a gas valve and after that forgotten to turn it back on. Trace the gas line back from the furnace to the meter, and if you see a deal with that's perpendicular to the gas pipe, turn it so it's parallel. Gas furnace repair is depends upon how old your furnace is. If you have an old furnace or boiler, you might have a pilot light. Get rid of the front panel and the burner cover and check to make sure it's lit.<p>
<p>A blocked furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut off. Filthy filters are the most typical reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt limit air flow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too rapidly, and your house won't heat up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, replace the filter. A dirty filter also causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, lowering the effectiveness of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
