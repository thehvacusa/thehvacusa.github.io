<p>The most typical source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which homes are developed. As uranium naturally breaks down, it launches radon gas which is a colorless, odorless, radioactive gas.

<h3>Residential and Commercial HVAC Services at Bronxville NY</h3>
<p>Another method to decreasing the concentrations of indoor air pollutants in your home is to increase the quantity of outside air coming inside. Most house heating and cooling systems, consisting of forced air heating systems, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your home. Opening doors and windows, operating window or attic fans, when the weather condition allows, or running a window air conditioning unit with the vent control open boosts the outside ventilation rate. Local bathroom or kitchen area fans that tire outdoors get rid of contaminants directly from the room where the fan is located and also increase the outside air ventilation rate.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outside air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
