<p>An indoor air toxin is a compound in the air that may affect the health of individuals who live in the house. Contaminants could originate from outside the home-- such as an idling automobile engine in an attached garage, backyard garbage burning, or radon getting in your house from the ground below. An air pollutant could likewise originate from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide from a faulty furnace, unstable natural substances (VOCs) from a newly painted space, pre-owned smoke, mold growing on wet or damp carpeting, or chemicals from hobbies, family cleaning, or personal care products. Viruses and germs, family pet dander, and pest parts (dust mites or roaches) are other possible indoor air toxins.<p>
<p>Normally the most reliable method to enhance indoor air quality is to eliminate specific sources of contamination or to decrease their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas ranges, can be adjusted to decrease the quantity of emissions. Oftentimes, source control is also a more affordable approach to securing indoor air quality than increasing ventilation because increasing ventilation can increase energy expenses. Specific sources of indoor air contamination in your house are listed later in this section.<p>
<p>It's on days like these that the concept of an in-floor heating unit appears less like a high-end item and more like a need.
