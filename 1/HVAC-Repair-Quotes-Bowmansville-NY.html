<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have actually heard of the $5000 rule but got ta provide whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one inside your home and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply crazy and all over the place and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
