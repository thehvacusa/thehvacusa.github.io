<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the two technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
