<p>There are 116 highly-rated local duct cleaners. Indoor pollution sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the primary reason for indoor air quality problems in homes. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor toxin levels by not generating enough outdoor air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air pollutants out of the home. Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
<p>The life-span of a central air conditioning system is considered to be 15-20 years, and today's air conditioners are more energy effective than models made even 5 years earlier, so it makes financial sense to change or upgrade your unit if it's 5 years of ages or older. The best central air conditioner you can purchase today will use 30-50% less energy than one purchased in 1975 while delivering the exact same quantity of cooling.<p>

<p>The residential or commercial properties and composition of the soil in an area can impact the rate at which heat is conducted through the ground. These should be considered before selecting the best style of an underground heating & cooling system. Soil with positive heat transfer homes needs fewer pipes to achieve the desired underground heating & cooling impact, while those with lowered thermal conductivity will need more pipes.<p>
<p>Geographically, some areas pay consistently greater earnings for air conditioning tradespersons. This may be due to high cost of living, remoteness, unfavorable climate, or just a high level of competitors for skilled trades.

The District of Columbia ranked second, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 per year. New Jersey had the third-highest typical wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 each year.
