<p>Called WSE for a regular inspection. The tech showed up right on time and was well-informed & friendly throughout the go to. They recommended replacing a couple of parts that were heading out. They weren't low-cost however a quick internet search confirmed WSE wasn't pumping up rates, so I gladly had them changed. Nevertheless, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in exact same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was faulty. No charge for the see or the new part. I was really happy they waited their work and repaired the problem. Will definitely be utilizing them again.<p>

<h3>Signs It's Time to Replace Your Boiler in Westview KY</h3>
<p>Geothermal heatpump are very effective, since ground source heating is extracted from depths where the temperature level is always at a continuous temperature. These systems can attain a geothermal performance of about 300 to 600 percent during the, Coldest winter season nights; whereas air-source heatpump can only achieve an effectiveness of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter season. Similar to other types of heatpump, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal performance rated according to their coefficient of performance (POLICE). POLICE rates how much heat a system gets rid of or produces (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system uses to develop the heating or cooling result. The majority of ground source heat pumps have Police officers of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this means is that for each system of energy utilized by a geothermal heat pump, approximately 3 to 5 units are provided back in the type of heat.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common mix utilized in automobiles in the U.S. up until 1994, when most styles altered to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting capacity of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer made in the U.S. for this type of application, but is still imported and can be acquired and utilized by licensed HVAC technicians. For systems needing only an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in excellent working order and carrying out far much better than virtually all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "inexpensive" by lots of people.<p>

<p>I typically do not leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You don't prepare for needing to change your AC system. Regrettably for us, we had no other option. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my choices. After service hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and discuss alternatives. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a family buddy and now I will recommend this company to my buddies.<p>
