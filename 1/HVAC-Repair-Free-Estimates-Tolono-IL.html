<p>I normally don't leave reviews but wished to share my experience. You do not expect having to replace your AC system. Regrettably for us, we had no other alternative. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my alternatives. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and discuss options. I scheduled my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family pal and now I will suggest this company to my buddies.<p>

While an area heater is in usage, open a door from the space where the heating system is located to the rest of the house and open a window slightly.<p>
