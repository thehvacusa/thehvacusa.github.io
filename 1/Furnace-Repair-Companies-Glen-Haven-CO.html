<p>Because an a/c unit moves heat in between the indoor coil and the outside coil, both need to be kept tidy. This means that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is likewise necessary to frequently clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will ultimately lead to damage to the compressor, because the condenser coil is accountable for releasing both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat created by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
