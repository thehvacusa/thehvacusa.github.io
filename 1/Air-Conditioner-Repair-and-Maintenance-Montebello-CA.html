<p>Current Review: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was educated and courteous. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
