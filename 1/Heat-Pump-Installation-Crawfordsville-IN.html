<p>We tend to think of air contamination as something outdoors - ozone, haze, or smog hanging in the air, particularly in summertime. These convection heaters are still extensively utilized and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat.

<p>Radiant heat covers a series of different heating systems, consisting of electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heat systems operate on similar principles.

In the case of electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating aspects. As the warm water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the floor and into the room.<p>
