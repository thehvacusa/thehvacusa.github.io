<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound considering that 1978. The selection of indoor units has one constraint: their overall power should not exceed the capability of the outside unit. In practice, nevertheless, it is extremely typical to see a multi-split system with an overall capacity of indoor units higher than the outdoor capacity by a minimum of 20%. However, it is wrong to expect much better performance when all indoor systems are turned on at the exact same time, since the total capability of the entire system is limited by the capacity of the outside system. Simply put, the outside unit will distribute all its power to all operating indoor systems in such a method that some of the rooms might not have a very comfortable temperature level. However, the calculation of the overall power is not easy, since it takes into consideration not just the small power of the systems, however also the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>
<p>When installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones, the main issue. While installing a separate split system, workers attempt to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal.

The first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not allow you to set the air conditioning separately for each room. However, now the market has a broad choice of multi-split systems, in which the practical characteristics of indoor units operate independently from each other.<p>
