<p>Packaged terminal ac system (PTAC) systems are likewise known as wall-split a/c systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are frequently utilized in hotels, have 2 separate systems (terminal bundles), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing unit on the outside, with an opening passing through the wall and connecting them. This decreases the interior system footprint and allows each space to be changed individually. PTAC systems might be adapted to supply heating in cold weather, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to draw and heat the interior heat from the exterior air, transforming the a/c unit into a heatpump While room cooling offers optimum flexibility, when used to cool numerous spaces at a time it is normally more costly than central air.<p>

However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to wear and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
