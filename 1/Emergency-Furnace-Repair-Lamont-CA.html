<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heating system, controlling the power to the heating wires and likewise managing the temperature level of the flooring. All circuitry for your radiant heat system either runs to it or from it. Many people will install their thermostat near the entrance of the space they are heating, near the light switches. Nevertheless, anywhere you install it is great as long as the area is unblocked and dry.<p>
<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment generally lasts decades, since it is protected inside. When it does need to be changed, the expense is much less than putting in a whole new geothermal system, since the loop or well is the most costly to set up. New technical guidelines remove the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some poorly sized systems did get too hot or overcool the ground over time, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature level gradient to function.<p>
<p>Normally the most efficient way to improve indoor air quality is to get rid of individual sources of pollution or to minimize their emissions.
