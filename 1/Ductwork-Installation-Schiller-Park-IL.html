He offered to come back today, however I moved it to tomorrow. James is among the nicest, most good people I have satisfied in a very long time.

<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
