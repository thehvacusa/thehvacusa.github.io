Radiant heating, for example, may be a far better suitable for your needs.<p>
<p>Inquire about training and accreditations. A good place to begin is the North American Technician Excellence (NATE) accreditation. It's kind of a minimum requirement for selecting an HVAC company, however a great deal of contractors out there have not bothered with it! Kick it up a notch by looking for Structure Efficiency Institute (BPI) accreditation.
