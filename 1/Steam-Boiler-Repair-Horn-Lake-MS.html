<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively steady gradually. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a building as reasonably unchanged physical product gradually. In fact, the real nature of buildings can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research using the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
