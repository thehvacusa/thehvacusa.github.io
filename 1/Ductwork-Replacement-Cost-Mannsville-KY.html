<p>Central air conditioning systems are measured in lots. This measurement is based on the system's capability to cool your home. For example, a 1 lot unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in tons, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This means a 4.5 ton system will cool 54,000 BTUs.

<p>Next, and perhaps simply as important when it pertains to central air costs, is the AC system's size.
