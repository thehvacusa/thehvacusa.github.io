<p>Even if your central air conditioner is simply eight to ten years old, it might suck up to two times the electricity that even a low-end new one would utilize. That's due to the fact that it operates at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio, which is the quantity of energy required to supply a particular cooling output. Till 2006, 10 SEER was standard, however these days, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER.

<h3>Boiler Maintenance at Saint Cloud FL - Reasons Why You Would Have to Reset The Boiler</h3>
<p>Throughout winter, the ground source heat is soaked up by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  service through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid circulates around this loop, sending the absorbed heat to a refrigerant via the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas.

From here, the gas transfers to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heating unit.<p>
