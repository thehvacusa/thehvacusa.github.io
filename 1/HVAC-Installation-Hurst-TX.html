<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may think. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, economical flexible hose pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and wear and is quickly pierced.<p>
