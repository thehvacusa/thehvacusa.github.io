<p>If you suspect a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of visible growth or a musty odor regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much excellent if it does not remove the mold. Mold starts with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can maintain and examine. Dripping return ducts can also present moisture. Again, if you suspect a mold problem, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>

Porous products, ceiling, wall, and flooring coverings, and furniture found in the basements that have actually been wet for over 24 to 2 days might become a source for mold development and must be discarded. Often there is a moldy odor but mold can not be seen. Mold does not require light to grow and can prosper in surprise or seldom accessed locations of your home, such as behind walls or in the attic.
