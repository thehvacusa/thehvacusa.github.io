<p>A health survey ought to be developed and distributed to all concerned employees. Such a tool must identify the number of people impacted; define ages and task descriptions of involved workers; figure out where they are located within the workplace; show when the symptoms occur (time of day, day of week, and time of year); supply a list of specific health signs or health problems; recognize all devices run in the workplace; indicate the type of outdoors air contamination; and determine possible sources of job stress.<p>
<p>Cooling can also be offered by a procedure called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added because the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, thereby declining its efficiency.<p>
<p>Allergens are materials that cause an immune-type reaction in individuals who are sensitized to these products.
