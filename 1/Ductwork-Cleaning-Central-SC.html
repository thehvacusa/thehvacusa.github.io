<p>The bureau projects 34 percent work growth for HVAC technicians in between 2010 and 2020, more than two times the average for all occupations. Several elements add to this, including the replacement and upgrade of older a/c systems to meet more stringent environmental policies. The slow rebound in residential and industrial building and construction will create a constant flow of new chances, especially for professionals who are willing to move. New systems are more electronic and advanced, so technicians who have actually finished formal training programs at a technical or community college might have a benefit over those who learn on the job.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are often more difficult to control than they seem due to aspects such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE advises temperature levels varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity needs to be kept at or listed below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to decrease mold growth.<p>
<p>It's on days like these that the concept of an in-floor heating system appears less like a luxury item and more like a requirement. (Besides, heated up floors were great enough for the Roman Empire) But before you commit to what can be a major renovation job, it's best to ask yourself whether a glowing flooring heating unit is a proper service for your specific home heating needs.<p>
