Structures continuously progress as an outcome of the changes in the environment around them in addition to the residents, materials, and activities within them. The various surface areas and the air inside a building are constantly interacting, and this interaction leads to changes in each. For example, we might see a window as changing somewhat over time as it ends up being unclean, then is cleaned up, collects dirt again, is cleaned once again, and so on through its life. In fact, the dirt" we see might be progressing as a result of the interactions amongst the moisture, chemicals, and biological products found there.<p>
<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is basic. Heat increases, so it makes sense to find the heat source at the floor level. This lets the heat naturally travel through the hot" zone, which is from an individual's toe to head location. All objects in the hot zone reach stability in temperature after the radiant heat system has actually been running for a while, including people. When the furnace kicks in and that abrupt shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>
