<p>Airflow patterns in structure are figured out by the combined forces of mechanical ventilation systems, human activity, and natural impacts. Atmospheric pressure distinctions produced by these forces move airborne toxins from locations of greater pressure to areas of lower pressure through any readily available opening in building walls, ceilings, floors, doors, windows, and HVAC systems. Even if the opening is little, air will move till the inside pressure amounts to the outside.<p>
<p>Ventilation: Reducing pollutant concentration by using cleaner (outdoor) air to dilute polluted (indoor) air. Local building codes likely specify the quantity (and in some cases quality) of outside air that must be continually supplied in your structures, as do voluntary requirements set by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHREA). Briefly increasing ventilation combined with appropriate use of the exhaust system while painting or applying pesticides, for instance, can be beneficial in watering down the concentration of toxic fumes in the air.<p>
