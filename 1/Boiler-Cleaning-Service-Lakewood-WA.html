<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor office, classroom or laboratory environments, instead of commercial or outdoor settings. In tasks where union membership is not a concern, an HVAC technician may complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This includes cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, attaching the ducts to the HVAC unit, and mounting the ductwork in the structure. It may also consist of the installation of registers where the ductwork links to specific areas.<p>
<p>Geothermal HVAC systems are becoming common functions of environment-friendly homes as part of the growing green structure movement.

That's approaching 30 to 40 percent of the whole housing market.<p>
