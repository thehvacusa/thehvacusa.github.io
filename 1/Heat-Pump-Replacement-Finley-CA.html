<p>We tend to think of air contamination as something outside - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, specifically in summer season. These convection heaters are still commonly used and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered also.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding job finding the outdoor unit as near to your house as possible per my request. The task took two days and my yard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely experienced of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
