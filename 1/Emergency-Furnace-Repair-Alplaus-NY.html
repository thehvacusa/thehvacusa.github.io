<p>A third method to decide whether your home may have poor indoor air quality is to take a look at your lifestyle and activities. Human activities can be considerable sources of indoor air pollution. Finally, search for signs of problems with the ventilation in your home. Signs that can indicate your house may not have enough ventilation include moisture condensation on walls or windows, stuffy or foul-smelling air, unclean central heating and air cooling equipment, and areas where books, shoes, or other products become moldy. To detect smells in your house, step outside for a few minutes, and after that upon reentering your home, note whether smells are obvious.<p>
<p>Consider prospective results of indoor air contamination if you utilize an unvented kerosene or gas area heating unit. Follow the producer's instructions, especially instructions on the proper fuel and keeping the heating system properly adjusted. A relentless yellow-tipped flame is generally a sign of maladjustment and increased contaminant emissions. While a space heating system is in usage, open a door from the space where the heating unit lies to the remainder of the home and open a window a little.<p>
