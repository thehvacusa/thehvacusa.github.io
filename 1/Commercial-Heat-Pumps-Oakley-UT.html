<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure.
