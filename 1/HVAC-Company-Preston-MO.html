<p>Cooling can also be offered by a procedure called free cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is included due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, thereby decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
<p>Aside from area heating, the geothermal heating system can also be linked to a device known as a geothermal desuperheater. The geothermal desuperheater can recycle the excess heat produced from the ground source heatpump compressor and utilizes it to heat water. This indicates that this device can likewise provide free hot water for domestic use in addition to its traditional geothermal heating and cooling purpose.<p>
<p>Advanced styles of brand-new homes are beginning to include mechanical systems that bring outside air into the house. Some of these styles include energy-efficient heat healing ventilators (also known as air-to-air heat exchangers).
