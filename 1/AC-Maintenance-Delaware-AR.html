<p>Immediate results might appear after a single direct exposure or repeated exposures. These consist of irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and tiredness. Such instant effects are typically short-term and treatable. In some cases the treatment is just getting rid of the individual's direct exposure to the source of the pollution, if it can be determined. Signs of some diseases, consisting of asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, might also appear soon after direct exposure to some indoor air toxins.<p>

This could be through a public offering, a sale to a large organisation in the field, and even a sale to another PE company. CoolSys is an HVAC contractor owned by PE company Ares Management.
