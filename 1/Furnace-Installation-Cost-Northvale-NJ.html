<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have actually become aware of the $5000 rule however got ta provide whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one indoors and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just crazy and all over the place and I guess they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
