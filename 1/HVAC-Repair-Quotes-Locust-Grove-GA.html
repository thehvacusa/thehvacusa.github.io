<h3>Indoor Air Conditioner in Locust Grove GA</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never ever have heard of the $5000 guideline however got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one inside your home and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply insane and all over the location and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
