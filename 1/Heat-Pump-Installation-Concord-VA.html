<p>It prevails to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady in time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment).

Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
