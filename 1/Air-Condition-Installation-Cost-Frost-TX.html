Again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid website with a program. While Angie's list is a good base line indication that you MIGHT be working with a respectable company, you still need to do your homework (not all contractors with a comparable score are the exact same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>

There are a range of humidifier choices that will help maintain consistent humidity levels and produce comfortable living conditions in your home.<p>
