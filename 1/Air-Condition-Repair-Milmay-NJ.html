<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. The selection of indoor systems has one restriction: their overall power must not exceed the capacity of the outdoor unit.

However, it is incorrect to expect much better efficiency when all indoor systems are switched on at the exact same time, given that the total capacity of the whole system is restricted by the capability of the outside unit. Basically, the outdoor unit will distribute all its power to all operating indoor units in such a method that a few of the spaces might not have an extremely comfortable temperature level. Nevertheless, the computation of the overall power is not simple, given that it takes into account not just the nominal power of the units, but also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>

<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Just take a picture of the wires before disconnecting anything (you may need a referral in the future). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4).

The female crimp ports must snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. Get rid of the adapter and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Protect the new capacitor (Photo 5) when you have actually switched all the wires.<p>
