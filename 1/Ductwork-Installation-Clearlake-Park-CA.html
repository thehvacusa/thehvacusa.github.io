<p>WE ARE ALSO USING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe in between the pipes getting in and the pipes leaving the conventional water heater. Install a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional hot water heater are open, water will flow from the solar storage tank to the standard water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the pipes entering and the pipes leaving the conventional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the traditional water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summertime when water temperatures are high, and the standard water heater can be shut down totally.<p>
<p>The primary issue when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones. While setting up a separate split system, employees try to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Setting up a multi-split system creates more difficulties, given that some of indoor systems can be located far from the exterior. The first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not allow you to set the air conditioning separately for each room. Nevertheless, now the market has a wide choice of multi-split systems, in which the practical characteristics of indoor systems operate separately from each other.<p>
