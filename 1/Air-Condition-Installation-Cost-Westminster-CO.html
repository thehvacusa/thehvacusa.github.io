Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas ranges, can be adjusted to decrease the amount of emissions.

<p>Central air conditioners, typically described as central air" or split-system air conditioning", circulate cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and registers (i.e., openings in the walls, ceilings, or floorings covered by grills) carry cooled air from the air conditioning unit to the house. This cooled air becomes warmer as it flows through the house; then it recedes to the central air conditioner through return ducts and registers. Discover how central air conditioning conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
