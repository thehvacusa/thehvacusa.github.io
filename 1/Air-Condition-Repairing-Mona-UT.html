<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the car debit, although my company does not offer auto debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized amount of cash coming in monthly, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. , if we do choose to offer vehicle debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Agreement.. There ought to not be any reason that your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>
