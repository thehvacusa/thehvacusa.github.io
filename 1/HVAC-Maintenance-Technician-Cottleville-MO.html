<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
