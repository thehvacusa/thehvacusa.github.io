<p>Cooling can likewise be supplied by a process called free cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is included since the temperature of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, therefore declining its effectiveness.<p>
