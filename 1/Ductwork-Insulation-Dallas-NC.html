<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government company, performed a research study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it lowers energy costs by enhancing air flow. After evaluating 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no considerable enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy effectiveness. Sometimes, measured particle levels actually increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
