<p>Exposure Control: Adjusting the time and location of toxin direct exposure. An example of time control is setting up flooring waxing and removing (with the ventilation system functioning) on a Friday.

Location control involves moving the pollutant source away from residents and even relocating vulnerable occupants.<p>
<p>Airflow patterns in building are identified by the combined forces of mechanical ventilation systems, human activity, and natural impacts.

Even if the opening is small, air will move until the within pressure is equal to the exterior.<p>
<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 came into force in 2000 and banned using ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Regulation banned using R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This means that equipment that uses R22 can still run, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now prohibited, systems that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and kept.<p>
