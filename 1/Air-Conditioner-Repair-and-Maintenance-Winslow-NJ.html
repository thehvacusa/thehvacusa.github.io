<p>All homes need effective ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others.

If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it turns on or is humming, there may be an internal issue. While humming is caused by a slipped belt in the internal functions, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or perhaps an unclean burner.<p>
