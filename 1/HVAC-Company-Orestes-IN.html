Gas furnace not blowing hot air? Simply as with switches, someone might have turned off a gas valve and after that forgotten to turn it back on. Trace the gas line back from the furnace to the meter, and if you see a handle that's perpendicular to the gas pipe, turn it so it's parallel. Gas furnace repair is depends on how old your furnace is. You may have a pilot light if you have an old furnace or boiler. Eliminate the front panel and the burner cover and inspect to make certain it's lit.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage present to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear out and are at the top of the list of typical air conditioning service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every five years or two. Loosen the old AC contactor before getting rid of the wires. Then move the wires to the brand-new system (Photo 6).<p>

<p>Current Evaluation: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was polite and educated. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>

<p>We look at ideas before we supply advice to change instead of repair a heater. Among the ideas we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy costs are high compared to usage, or if energy bills are higher year after year, we know the system is not running efficiently. It might be in perfect condition, but if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to replace it with a more effective model, then you would be squandering cash by not replacing the older system.<p>
<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particle matter is a mix of liquid beads and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, pollen, and smoke. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- since they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outside PM, produced by construction, for instance, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into structures through mechanical and natural ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
