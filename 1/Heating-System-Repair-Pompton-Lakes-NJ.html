<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high effectiveness, and are often combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summer season a/c. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage.

<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is brought on by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main path of direct exposure is through the development of an aerosol effect, most typically from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial structures is from improperly positioned or kept evaporative cooling towers, which frequently release water in an aerosol which may go into close-by ventilation consumption. Break outs in medical facilities and nursing homes, where patients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most frequently reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has actually involved outside water fountains in public tourist attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial building water products is highly under-reported, as healthy individuals need heavy direct exposure to obtain infection.<p>
