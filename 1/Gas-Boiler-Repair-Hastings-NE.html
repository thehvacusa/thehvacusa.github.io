<p>All houses need effective ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on however the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot burner has been stressed out from use. Another possible factor could be a broken thermostat, preventing the furnace from adjusting to the correct temperature. Furnaces that kick on regularly might be because of a filthy filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air appropriately. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it turns on or is humming, there might be an internal issue. While humming is triggered by a slipped belt in the internal workings, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or perhaps a dirty burner.<p>
