<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 professionals I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts.

The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
