<p>SysTech Design focuses on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for improving and preserving the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The same applies for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it flows through your house. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to adhere to and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils ensures dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from collecting on and beneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>
<p>Truth: Federal and local incentives typically total up to between 30 and 60 percent of total geothermal system cost, which can typically make the initial rate of a system competitive with conventional equipment.

Geothermal HVAC systems begin at about $5,000 per lot, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per load. However, brand-new installation practices are reducing costs, to the point where the price is getting closer to traditional systems under the best conditions.<p>
