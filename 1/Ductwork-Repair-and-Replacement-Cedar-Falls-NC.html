<p>They were excellent! So many HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to supply you with the service initially requested. They met my needs totally by supplying an expert quote with options, without pressing extra products. The team showed up on time, kept me notified as they worked, and finished a little early. The also quickly followed up with the required assessments from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely recommend this company.<p>
<p>Many people are ending up being more aware and concerned about their health and the impact of indoor air quality. Dust and dirt containing allergens and contaminants can cover the cooling ductwork with time. Sometimes it should be removed to enhance and refresh the quality of indoor air and improve the cooling. Beacon Plumbing, Seattle, WA cleans up the duct physically by eliminating the particles from the air filter.<p>
<p>A geothermal HVAC is not the like geothermal energy though, and the two need to not be puzzled. Where a geothermal HVAC taps into the heat inside the earth for space heating, cooling or for heating one's water system, geothermal energy is the procedure by which the heat inside the earth is used for creating power in the type of electricity. The 2 operations utilize different processes, with geothermal energy requiring water be warmed to boiling point to achieve its goals.<p>
