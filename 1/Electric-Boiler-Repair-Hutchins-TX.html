<p>4 Seasons has actually installed both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the annual maintenance. I have found them to be fairly priced, timely and do fine work. When they installed my main furnace they went well beyond what was required and renovated the entire plenum and the duct work for the water heater since the technicians thought they simply didn't seem ideal and they couldn't leave them that way. No extra charge.<p>
