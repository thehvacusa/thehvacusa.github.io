<p>How environment modification impacts air quality and exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature (which is a basic mode of operation for modern a/c unit) needs that the rate of energy elimination by the air conditioning unit boost. This increase has the effect that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioner removes that energy. 39 To do so, the ac system must increase its power intake by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of performance) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is activated, and the ac system has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The a/c's power intake will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, thus making the 100 W heating component cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
