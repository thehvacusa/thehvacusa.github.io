<p>The compressor can overheat and shut down if the condenser coils are blocked. You'll experience periodic durations of very little cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you're sure" the condenser coils are clean, clean them once again. Turn off the power. Turn the air conditioning service and furnace breaker in your primary electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, switch off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then yank the disconnect block (Photo 1) and clean the condenser coils (Photo 2). If the cooling service still doesn't work appropriately after you've cleaned up the condenser coils, set up a brand-new filter and opened all the supply vents, continue with the following repairs.
