<p>The predominant health result associated with direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might pose dangers, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes countless preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. Your risk of lung cancer is particularly high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>
