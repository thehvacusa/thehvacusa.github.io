A ducted heat pump system may be most affordable if your house or structure has an existing duct system that remains in good condition. Using existing ductwork will remove the requirement to install a pricey brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>When the heat pump headed out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was really useful in gathering details on the phone and providing clear guidelines about how to briefly manage the issue and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably effective and provided clear communication about the problem, its treatments, and its future avoidance. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will absolutely use Integrity Energy Systems again, for workplace and home.<p>
