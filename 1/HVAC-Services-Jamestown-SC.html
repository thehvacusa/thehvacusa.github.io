<h3>Why You Need Air Conditioning Repair in Jamestown SC?</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was quick and very clear about his evaluation, guaranteeing I understood what was kept an eye out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So maybe a little steep on cost for this service, however the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
<p>I have actually become fairly proficient at investigating items on line prior to purchasing them. However I don't discover that there is a central area for searching details about the "real" value of house HVAC systems or possibly I need to state a truthful evaluation of these products. Considering that I reside in FL it is crucial to have an excellent AC unit in your house since they are truly taxed in the summer season.<p>

<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
