<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently receives ask for assessment and help in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, numerous homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation step. However, a number of these houses were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this product. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was installed many years ago are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>Called WSE for a regular evaluation. The tech showed up right on time and was well-informed & friendly throughout the visit. They suggested changing a couple of parts that were heading out. They weren't inexpensive but a fast web search validated WSE wasn't pumping up rates, so I happily had them replaced. However, a week later on the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was malfunctioning.
