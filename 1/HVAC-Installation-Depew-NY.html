They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, however they had to order it. My partner stated that she had seen a fantastic evaluation for James, so I called. He can be found in a few hours (weaving a mask) and discussed the circumstance to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 total.

As a client you need to be well informed in order not to be completely benefited from. Many companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer new versus repair. Lastly discovered someone to effectively service and the unit has actually been operating problem complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
