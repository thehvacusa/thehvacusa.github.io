<h3>Electric Heating Systems in Glenmoore Pennsylvania</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a regular examination. The tech showed up right on time and was well-informed & friendly throughout the see. They advised replacing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't cheap but a fast web search verified WSE wasn't pumping up rates, so I happily had them changed. Nevertheless, a week later on the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they set up the week prior was faulty. No charge for the go to or the new part.
