<h3>HVAC Supply in Suplee PA</h3>
<p>I typically do not leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You do not prepare for having to change your AC system. Regrettably for us, we had no other option. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my options. After service hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and talk about choices. I scheduled my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a household friend and now I will recommend this company to my pals.<p>
<p>Brian was every bit truthful, responsive and pleasant. Jeremiah Bartula the plumbing technician discussed our alternatives prior to our work with Brian and was incredible, helpful and valuable - his work was impressive! All of his assistants were respectful and conscientious. The work site was left absolutely cleared and cleaned up. We would extremely motivate others to go right to Berkshire Heating and Air Conditioning for all their heating and cooling requirements.<p>
<p>Inadequate maintenance of the HVAC system likewise might contribute to indoor air quality issues. Ventilation system filters that are not replaced on a regular basis might end up being clogged, minimizing air flow circulation, quality, and volume. They likewise may become places for molds and germs to grow and be distributed throughout the house. Humidifier systems on HVAC systems also need to be correctly preserved to avoid bacteria and mold contamination.<p>
<p>What do you do when the company that's supplying the service contract attempts to upsell you each time they come to carry out routine maintenance? If the coils were cleaned in March 2015, why would they be revealing "excessive rust" in June 2015 and require a deep cleaning for $400? They sold her a Reme Halo for $1,300, offering her a 10% discount if she renewed her PMA for 7 years, despite the fact that it was 6 months prior to the current one expired. She didn't need a air filtering system, however they talked her into it.<p>
