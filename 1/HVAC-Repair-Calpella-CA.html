<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't rewarding you would not provide them.  Secondly like prolonged vehicle service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the required skills to do the job and also the morals to deal with consumers fairly. As a consumer you need to be well informed in order not to be completely benefited from. A lot of companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to correctly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer new versus repair. Lastly found somebody to appropriately service and the unit has actually been operating problem free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

<p>As mentioned above, activating your brand-new under tile flooring heater prematurely, before the mortar has cured, can trigger the grout to crack or to not adhere effectively, and might void the service warranty of your mortar product.
