An unit that is too big will have a simple time keeping the house cool, however will have a more difficult time eliminating humidity from the air. On the other hand, a system that is too little will not have the ability to correctly cool the house on hot days.

<p>Strained Systems Overheat - When your system is dirty, and filters are plugged, and maybe refrigerant is low, it will not be working at optimal performance and might get too hot. This makes they HVAC system work harder, producing a cycle that does not end. An overworked system will likewise cause your energy costs to increase. It's possible that the size of AC system you have is not huge enough for your house. If the system is too little, it will need to work more difficult and might overheat. Usually, an HVAC system costs $4,820 to $9,350 to set up a 5-ton unit for a 2,000- to 3,000-square-foot house.<p>
