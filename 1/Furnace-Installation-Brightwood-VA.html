Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in because the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
