<p>Specialist heating system setups. Nevertheless, even the best-maintained heater will eventually fail. HVAC specialists advise following this basic rule when choosing whether it deserves investing in a repair: If the system is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost more than half the price of a new system, it's finest to buy new. At the 15-year mark, it may be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system won't have much more years left in it, and it's most likely to be utilizing more energy than required.<p>
