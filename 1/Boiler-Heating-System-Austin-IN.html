<p>. Before selecting the installation place of a/c unit, a number of main elements require to be thought about. First off, the direction of air circulation from the indoor systems must not fall on the place of rest or work area. Secondly, there need to not be any challenges en route of the air flow that may prevent it from covering the space of the premises as much as possible. The outdoor unit should also be located in an open space, otherwise the heat from your house will not be effectively discharged outside and the efficiency of the entire system will drop greatly.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is frequently in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice types on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system must momentarily change back into the routine a/c mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
