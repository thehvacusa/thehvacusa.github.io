<p>SysTech Design specializes in industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for improving and keeping the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The exact same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it circulates through your home. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to stick to and develop on the coils.

Just be worried if your house is not heating up. Nevertheless, if your system does not appear to be working effectively, check outside to see if your unit is frozen or covered in ice.
