<h3>What to Look for in an AC Heating Repair Service at Spinnerstown PA</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon hot water heater. It went fantastic. Dealing with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. 2 on demand tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The crew took the whole day as they needed to get rid of the old hot water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high effectiveness heating system. We selected getting something more costly than a conventional hot water heater as gas is among our biggest utility expenditures. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a long time and use extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
