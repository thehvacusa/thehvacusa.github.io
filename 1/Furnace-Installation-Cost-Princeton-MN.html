He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call company many years back and know the significance of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm likewise satisfied that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year.
