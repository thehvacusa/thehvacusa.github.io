<p>We tend to consider air pollution as something outdoors - haze, ozone, or smog hanging in the air, especially in summer. These convection heating units are still extensively utilized and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>A blocked furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut down. Filthy filters are the most common cause of furnace issues. Dust and dirt limit air flow-- and if the filter gets too blocked, the heat exchanger will shut and overheat off too quickly, and your home will not warm up. Replace the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. An unclean filter also triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, decreasing the efficiency of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>

For that reason, measurements of co2 for functions of assessing the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after a prolonged period of consistent occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indicator of ventilation adequacy.
