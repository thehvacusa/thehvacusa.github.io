<p>Asthmatic children are particularly at threat. EPA estimates that exposure to previously owned smoke increases the variety of episodes and intensity of signs in numerous countless asthmatic children, and may cause thousands of nonasth-matic kids to establish the disease each year. EPA estimates that between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic children have their condition made worse by direct exposure to pre-owned smoke each year. Direct exposure to pre-owned smoke triggers throat, nose, and eye irritation.
