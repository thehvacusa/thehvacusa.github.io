<p>Our line of IoT sensing units allow you to from another location keep an eye on a range of air quality attributes, and our dashboard-- accessible to you anytime, from anywhere-- provides visual insight into your structure's environmental conditions. We'll also help you analyze all that data, and offer suggestions about ways you can minimize contaminants and improve your structure's general air quality. To learn more about Iota's indoor air quality tracking system and how it may work for you, call us-- we 'd like to assist.<p>
<p>An indoor air toxin is a compound in the air that may affect the health of people who reside in the house. Contaminants could originate from outside the home-- such as an idling cars and truck engine in a connected garage, backyard garbage burning, or radon getting in your house from the ground below. An air toxin might also come from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide from a malfunctioning furnace, unpredictable organic compounds (VOCs) from a newly painted room, pre-owned smoke, mold growing on damp or damp carpets, or chemicals from hobbies, family cleaning, or individual care products. Bacteria and infections, pet dander, and bug parts (dust mites or roaches) are other possible indoor air contaminants.<p>
<p>The primary factor house owners do not purchase an HVAC service agreement is the cost. They can cost between $150 and $500 per year, depending on the amount of services provided. If the system is new and still under a maker's warranty, the cost may not be beneficial. Any major repairs must be covered under the producer's warranty. However, some manufacturers require routine maintenance as a term of the warranty.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air are the primary reason for indoor air quality issues. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not bringing in sufficient outdoor air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air pollutants out of the area. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
