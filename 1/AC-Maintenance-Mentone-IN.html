<p>It is common to presume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively stable gradually. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a structure as relatively the same physical product with time. In reality, the true nature of structures can be deemed the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research study applying the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
