<h3>Tips To Help You Repair Your Own Furnace in Lexington NC</h3>
<p>All modern a/c systems, even small window package units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are normally of a light-weight gauze-like product, and should be replaced or washed as conditions call for. For instance, a building in a high dust environment, or a house with furry family pets, will need to have the filters altered more frequently than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as required will add to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to lost energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy costs; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow. In addition, really filthy or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is usually a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without airflow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>

<p>When the heatpump headed out in our workplaces, Taylor at Stability was really handy in gathering information on the phone and supplying clear instructions about how to temporarily cope with the issue and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day.
