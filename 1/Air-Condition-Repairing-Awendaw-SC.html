They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, however they needed to order it. My better half stated that she had seen a fantastic review for James, so I called. He came in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and described the circumstance to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He offered to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is among the best, most decent individuals I have fulfilled in a long time.
