<p>To say there are a great deal of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the a/c unit back into its original box, utilizing the dense-foam packing product to protect it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in the box. Set the box in a cool, dry place for the winter.

<p>Current Evaluation: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day.
