<p>An undersize system won't be able to cool spaces down completely on the hottest days and will cost more to operate because it needs to run longer than a properly sized unit. An oversize compressor also costs more to operate since it simply takes more electricity to run a larger system. And an oversize unit doesn't lower humidity effectively. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so rapidly that it turns off prior to it has a chance to flow the appropriate volume of air past the coils to draw out the needed moisture. The result is a space that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature shows. In fact, the space can feel wet and clammy.<p>
