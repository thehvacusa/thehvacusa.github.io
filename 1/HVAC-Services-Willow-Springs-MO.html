<p>When they put a 24 hour emergency ac repair demand, many Midtown Houston Tx customers do not understand why their HVAC system is not working. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outside unit we'll be frozen too. Depending upon how thick the ice build-up is at your condensing unit, then you'll have a good concept of how thick the ice build-up remains in the evaporator coil. The first thing you need to do is to check your conditioning filters. If your filter is dirty, you're in luck, that's more than likely your problem. If you discovered that your conditioning filter needs replacing, then the next step is to thaw your cooling devices. The simplest method to defrost your HVAC equipment is to leave the unit off for a few hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
