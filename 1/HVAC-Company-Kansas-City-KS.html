<p>For instance, issues develop when, in an effort to conserve energy, ventilation systems are not utilized to bring in appropriate amounts of outside air. Insufficient ventilation also happens if the air supply and return vents within each room are obstructed or positioned in such a way that outdoor air does not in fact reach the breathing zone of building occupants. Improperly situated outdoor air consumption vents can also bring in air infected with auto and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from washrooms.

<h3>Comparing Commercial Boilers into Residential Boilers in Kansas City KS</h3>
<p>During winter, the ground source heat is taken in by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze option through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid distributes around this loop, transmitting the taken in heat to a refrigerant by means of the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas. From here it goes through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct result of the compression process. From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heating system.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
