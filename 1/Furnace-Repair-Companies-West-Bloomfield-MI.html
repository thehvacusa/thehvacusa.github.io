Sometimes, measured particle levels in fact increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning however returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't rewarding you wouldn't provide them.. Second of all like extended vehicle warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the required skills to do the task and likewise the morals to treat customers relatively. As a client you need to be well informed in order not to be totally taken advantage of. The majority of companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to correctly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer new versus repair. Lastly found someone to appropriately service and the unit has been operating problem free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
