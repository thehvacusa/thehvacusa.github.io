<p>Employers are required to follow the General Responsibility Stipulation of the OSHAct, which needs them to offer workers with a safe workplace that does not have any known hazards that cause or are most likely to cause death or serious injury. The OSHAct likewise needs employers to follow occupational security and health requirements created under it. Companies must be fairly familiar with the possible sources of poor air quality, and they should have the resources essential to acknowledge and control workplace dangers. It is likewise their obligation to notify staff members of the immediate risks that are present.Specific state and local guidelines might use.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
