<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the nose, throat, and eye and causes shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the risk of respiratory infection; there is likewise proof from animal research studies that repeated exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung illness such as emphysema. People at specific threat from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide include children and people with asthma and other respiratory illness.<p>
<p>Air toxins can range from pollutants generated from the outdoors by your pets to unsafe gas leaks. Carbon monoxide is a common air toxin arising from gas that gets away into your home without being burned off.

<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is caused by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary route of direct exposure is through the creation of an aerosol effect, most frequently from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from inadequately placed or kept evaporative cooling towers, which frequently launch water in an aerosol which may enter neighboring ventilation consumption. Outbreaks in medical facilities and nursing homes, where clients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most commonly reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outside water fountains in public tourist attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial building water products is highly under-reported, as healthy individuals require heavy exposure to get infection.<p>
