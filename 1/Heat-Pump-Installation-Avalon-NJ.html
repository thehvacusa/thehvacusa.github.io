Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts.

The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
