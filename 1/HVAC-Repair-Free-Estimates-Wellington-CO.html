<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, relatively stable in time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a structure as relatively unchanged physical material gradually. In truth, the true nature of structures can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and understood as intricate systems. Research using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
