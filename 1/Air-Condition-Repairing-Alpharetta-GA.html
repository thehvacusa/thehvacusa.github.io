<p>All Points Heating uses home cooling, a/c unit installation, a/c unit maintenance that provide dependable, proven efficiency at high performance.

<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to end up. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. As soon as I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the cost terrific but Mark headed out of his way to personalize a few things in my home to make the total air circulation more enhanced. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I believe any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
