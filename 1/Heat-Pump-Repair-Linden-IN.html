Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Keep an eye out for signs of water leaks or flooding to stop mold from growing. Porous materials, ceiling, wall, and floor coverings, and furnishings discovered in the basements that have been damp for over 24 to two days might become a source for mold development and must be disposed of. Sometimes there is a moldy odor but mold can not be seen. Mold does not need light to grow and can flourish in covert or hardly ever accessed locations of your home, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a variety of surface areas: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on floor covering products including carpet underpadding. Chances are there will be mold growing nearby if a source of water or condensation can be discovered. Repair the moisture problem, either by finding the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Completely clean the location utilizing established health department suggestions.<p>
