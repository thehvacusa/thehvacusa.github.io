<p>Reality: Federal and local incentives normally total up to in between 30 and 60 percent of overall geothermal system cost, which can frequently make the initial price of a system competitive with standard equipment. Standard air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per lots of heating or cooling capacity, during new building and construction (houses typically use between one and five tons). Geothermal HVAC systems begin at about $5,000 per load, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per load. However, brand-new installation practices are minimizing costs, to the point where the cost is getting closer to traditional systems under the right conditions.<p>

<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is just 8 to 10 years old, it could suck up to twice the electricity that even a low-end brand-new one would use. That's because it operates at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio, which is the quantity of energy needed to supply a specific cooling output. Until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, but nowadays, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER.
