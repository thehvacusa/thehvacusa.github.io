<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel regularly gets ask for assessment and help in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. Throughout the 1970s, many house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation measure. Nevertheless, many of these houses were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this product. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was set up many years back are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>Energy performance can be improved much more in central heating systems by presenting zoned heating. This permits a more granular application of heat, similar to non-central heater. Zones are controlled by several thermostats. In water heating unit the thermostats manage zone valves, and in forced air systems they manage zone dampers inside the vents which selectively obstruct the flow of air.

<p>Just like many house improvement projects, the cost of a full central heating unit can differ commonly based on the size of the house. Many furnaces will last in between 15 and 20 years. In choosing a furnace, homeowner need to consider heat output and performance. Heat output is determined in British Thermal Units, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace should be matched to the size of the home. A small house, for instance, may not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace may heat the home too quickly and shut down for too long, resulting in inconsistent temperature levels.<p>
