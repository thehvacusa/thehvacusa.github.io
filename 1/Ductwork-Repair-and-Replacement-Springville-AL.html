<p>I normally don't leave reviews however wished to share my experience. You don't anticipate having to change your AC system. Unfortunately for us, we had no other choice. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my alternatives. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and discuss options. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family buddy and now I will recommend this company to my friends.<p>
