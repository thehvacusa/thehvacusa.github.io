<p>I have been utilizing them for many years for my organisations, my own houses and my real estate clients' houses. I went through 5 other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with various rates and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who described to me completely the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC stopped working at my rental home. He helped me problem shoot the issue when I called and he encouraged me to call warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the unit working once again. He is truthful, trusted, and sensible on price. It's hard to find a truthful AC man and I'm pleased I discovered Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>
