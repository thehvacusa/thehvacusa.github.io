<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is regularly in the variety of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), because heat pumps end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is since ice types on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system should temporarily change back into the routine air conditioning mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
