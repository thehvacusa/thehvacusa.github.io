<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Irritants are materials that trigger an immune-type reaction in individuals who are sensitized to these materials. Irritants found in indoor air are mostly biological product such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, germs, and mold. All of these materials are small particles, can become airborne, and hence, are easily inhaled. Allergens that are breathed in by sensitized individuals with asthma can trigger asthma attacks. For instance, if you think of a group of people with asthma, the presence of feline irritant might induce an asthma attack in people with feline allergies, but not in those individuals who do not have feline allergies.<p>
