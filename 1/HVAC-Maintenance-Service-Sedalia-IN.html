<p>Air conditioning can likewise be provided by a procedure called totally free cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added because the temperature of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thus declining its effectiveness.<p>
