However, the computation of the overall power is not easy, because it takes into consideration not only the nominal power of the units, but also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>

The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number indicating the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).
