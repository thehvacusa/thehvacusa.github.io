Mold starts with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and maintain. Leaky return ducts can likewise present moisture. Again, if you suspect a mold problem, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>

<h3>Heat Pumps: What Are They And How Do They Work in San Luis AZ?</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was fantastic and on time. Josh was extremely clear and quick about his examination, ensuring I understood what was watched out.
