<p>Ducted heat pump heating & cooling systems act much like standard central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces via a duct system.

Utilizing existing ductwork will remove the requirement to install a costly new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>It's not right away clear why Target would have provided an HVAC company external network gain access to, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. However according to a cybersecurity professional at a large retailer who asked not to be called since he did not have authorization to speak on the record, it is common for large retail operations to have a team that routinely keeps track of energy consumption and temperature levels in shops to save money on expenses (especially at night) and to alert shop supervisors if temperature levels in the shops fluctuate outside of an appropriate range that could prevent customers from shopping at the store.<p>

<p>Second, recognition of pollutant sources is often essential to determining the cause( s) of employee health signs. Such information can sometimes be obtained by asking for copies of air monitoring information from the company. If monitoring data is not readily available, yet a high number of health signs have actually been reported, the Union agent should request that the employer have air monitoring tests performed. Evaluation of this data may determine potentially hazardous sources of contamination and resultant employee health symptoms. However, when impurity concentrations are very low, keeping track of data may not describe the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
