<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on.

The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
