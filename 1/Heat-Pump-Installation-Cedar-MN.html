<p>SysTech Design focuses on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for enhancing and keeping the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The same applies for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your house. Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to adhere to and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils guarantees dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from collecting on and below the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
<p>Duct are responsible for dispersing hot and cold air throughout your house, offering a comfy climate in every room. However ducts that are not set up effectively or kept can disperse impurities from one room to another. Over time, dust, dander and even mold can accumulate in your ducts, lowering the total air quality. Employ a professional to make certain your ducts are circulating fresh, tidy air.<p>

<p>Both must be kept tidy because an air conditioner moves heat between the indoor coil and the outdoor coil. This means that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also required to frequently clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will ultimately lead to harm to the compressor, due to the fact that the condenser coil is accountable for releasing both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
