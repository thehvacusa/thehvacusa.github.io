<h3>Common Gas Furnace Parts and Issues in Lodi WI</h3>
<p>The icing issue becomes a lot more extreme with lower outdoor temperatures, so heatpump are frequently set up in tandem with a more standard type of heating, such as an electrical heating system, a natural gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is utilized instead of the heat pump during harsher winter season temperatures. In this case, the heatpump is used efficiently during the milder temperature levels, and the system is switched to the standard heat source when the outside temperature is lower.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
