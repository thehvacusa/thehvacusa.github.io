If you've installed the parts revealed and re-installed the detach block, repowered the circuit breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and reduced the temperature level below the indoor temperature level, and the unit doesn't fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>

<p>Have actually used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They give me top priority and a lower rate when I have issues. Bought a new main unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase prolonged service warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Excellent investment in my viewpoint. Never attempt to offer me something I don't require.<p>
