<p>I generally don't leave evaluations but wished to share my experience. You do not anticipate having to replace your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other choice. What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my choices. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and go over choices. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household friend and now I will recommend this company to my good friends.<p>
