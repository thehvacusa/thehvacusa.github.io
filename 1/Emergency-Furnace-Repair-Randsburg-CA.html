<p>Heating is the biggest energy cost in the typical home.

The sensible heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature level of the inbound air is reduced, but it is also more damp, so the total heat (reasonable heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. Some of the reasonable heat of the getting in air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the getting in air is dry enough, the outcomes can be quite considerable.<p>

<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, however lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based.

Portable instruments used to determine co2 ought to be calibrated often, and outside measurements used for estimations should be made close in time to indoor measurements.
