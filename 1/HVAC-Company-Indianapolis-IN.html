If a number of signs up were closed or the filter was blocked, the lowered airflow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. If you have actually altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the registers, deice the A-coil.

Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually solved the issue.<p>
