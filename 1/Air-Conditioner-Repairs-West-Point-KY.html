<p>Occupational direct exposure limits use dose-response information which reveal the health effects of repeated direct exposure to one specific chemical. Similar data is not readily available for long-term, low-level exposures to a combination of pollutants as is the case for IAQ issues. Presently, there is inadequate information readily available to forecast the impacts of direct exposure to a number of possibly harmful agents at the same time.<p>

<p>A matched system is the combination of products that make up your HVAC system. Depending on your region, a matched system can be composed of the following: an air conditioning system and furnace, a heatpump and furnace, a heatpump and air handler, an a/c unit and air handler, or an all-in-one packaged" system.

<p>Indoor air quality (also called "indoor ecological quality") explains how inside air can impact a person's health, ability, and comfort to work.
