<p>Correct ventilation helps enhance indoor air quality. It's simple to think that the air quality outside is worse than the air quality inside. We know about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air toxins are often 2 to 5 times greater than outside levels, and in many cases these levels can exceed 100 times that of outside levels of the same pollutants. Simply put, often the air inside can be more harmful than the air exterior.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent task finding the outside system as close to your home as possible per my request. The job took 2 days and my yard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely well-informed of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>When our furnace was dying, we got in touch with two local companies for quotes. While both were useful and valuable, Ballard Gas provided us a better deal, for exceptional service. Rather than a simple sales task, the owner of the company made a full evaluation of our heater and located ways we could have more even heat. He included these small but significant modifications in his quote. We decided to change from a gas furnace to an electric heat pump due to the fact that of recent warmer summers and for environmental reasons.<p>

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Simply today I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the exact same day. He knew simply what the issue was and fixed it really rapidly. But here is the very best ONE. About ten years ago my entire air conditioning and gas heat went absolutely dead.
