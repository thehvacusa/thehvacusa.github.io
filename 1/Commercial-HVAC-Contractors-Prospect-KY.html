<h3>Things to Look for When Hiring an Prospect KY HVAC Professional</h3>
<p>Most residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The existing pattern in house construction is to minimize air leakage through cracks and other openings in floors, walls, and roofs.

The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside makeup air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living locations of residential buildings. The ASHRAE guidelines for make-up air for bathroom and kitchens in houses are much higher. This fresh makeup air dilutes indoor impurities and helps exhaust them from the home.<p>

Follow the instructions above under Ac system Not Blowing Air and describe your owner's manual.<p>
