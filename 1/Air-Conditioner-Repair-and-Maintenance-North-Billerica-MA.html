<h3>What is HVAC? HVAC Information For North Billerica MA Home Owners</h3>
<p>All modern-day air conditioning systems, even small window plan units, are geared up with internal air filters. These are normally of a lightweight gauze-like material, and must be changed or washed as conditions necessitate. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a home with furry animals, will require to have the filters altered more frequently than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will add to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in squandered energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy costs; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air flow. Additionally, very filthy or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>
