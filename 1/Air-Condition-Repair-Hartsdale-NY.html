<p>The effects of lead exposure on fetuses and kids can be extreme. They include delays in mental and physical advancement, lower IQ levels, shortened attention periods, and increased behavioral problems. Babies, children, and fetuses are more vulnerable to lead direct exposure than adults considering that lead is more easily soaked up into growing bodies, and the tissues of kids are more sensitive to the damaging results of lead. Children may have higher direct exposures since they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and then put their fingers or other lead-contaminated things into their mouths.<p>

The bacterium forms a biofilm which is resistant to chemical and antimicrobial treatments, including chlorine. Remediation for Legionella outbreaks in commercial buildings vary, but frequently include very warm water flushes (160 ° F; 70 ° C), sterilisation of standing water in evaporative cooling basins, replacement of shower heads, and sometimes flushes of heavy metal salts. Preventive procedures consist of adjusting typical hot water levels to permit 120 ° F( 50 ° C )at the tap, assessing center style layout, getting rid of faucet aerators, and periodic screening in suspect locations.<p>

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
