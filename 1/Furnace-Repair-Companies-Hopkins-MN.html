<p>The heatpump gained appeal in the 1950s in Japan and the United States. 12 Heatpump can draw out heat from various sources, such as ecological air, exhaust air from a structure, or from the ground. Heatpump move heat from outside the structure into the air within. Initially, heatpump HVAC systems were only used in moderate climates, however with improvements in low temperature level operation and minimized loads due to more effective houses, they are increasing in popularity in cooler environments.<p>
<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, suggesting they use air to exchange heat, in the very same way as a car radiator or common family air conditioning system does. Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It collects water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which needs to be vented outside the cooled area; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled location to the outdoors air.<p>
