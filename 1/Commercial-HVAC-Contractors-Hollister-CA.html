The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure.

<p>Recent Evaluation: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific.

He made the effort to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and polite. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
