<p>When your HVAC expert informs you to alter your filters frequently, they're not kidding. It's as crucial as a regular oil change in your car. An unclean filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and eventually reduce its life through wear and tear. Additionally, a fresh, clean filter better traps contaminants and debris in the air. As soon as every 3 months, Energy Star recommends changing your filter. During high use months, check the filters a minimum of month-to-month.<p>

<h3>Water Heater and HVAC System Maintenance in Chesterfield VA</h3>
<p>I confess I haven't done the math recently, however I've had a service contract on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to regular inspections. Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded right away, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 journeys to collaborate their deal with a company that was dealing with the patio area where the system sits. I feel like they offer me preferential treatment, and want to pay a bit more for that assurance.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is normally a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt once again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>

<h3>Air Conditioner Repairs Near me in Chesterfield VA</h3>
<p>One of the disadvantages of central heating is that it's potentially costly to set up, especially in an older house. Depending upon the kind of unit set up, it can be loud and trigger issues if you're extremely allergic to dust. Additionally, particular fuels and devices may require unique authorizations, and there is limited versatility in case of changed heating requirements. Throughout usage, there is a time delay while heat is being transported from the heating system to the living space.<p>
<p>A lot of well and city water does not typically include lead. Water generally picks up lead inside the home from family pipes that is made with lead materials. The only way to understand if there is lead in drinking water is to have it tested. Contact the local health department or the water supplier to learn how to get the water tested. Send for the EPA pamphlet, Lead and Your Drinking Water, to learn more about what you can do if you have lead in your drinking water. Call EPA's Safe Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) to find out more.<p>
