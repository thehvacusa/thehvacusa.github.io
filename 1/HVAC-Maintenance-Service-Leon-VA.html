<p>Central air conditioners are more efficient than space air conditioning unit. In addition, they run out the way, quiet, and hassle-free to run. To save energy and cash, you should shop an energy-efficient air conditioning unit and reduce your central air conditioner's energy use.

<p>IAQ can be affected by gases (consisting of carbon monoxide gas, radon, volatile organic substances ), particulates, microbial pollutants (mold, bacteria ), or any mass or energy stress factor that can cause unfavorable health conditions. Source control, filtration and making use of ventilation to dilute impurities are the main approaches for enhancing indoor air quality in the majority of buildings. Residential systems can even more improve indoor air quality by regular cleaning of carpets and rug.<p>
<p>Moisture management and humidity control requires running HVAC systems as developed. Moisture management and humidity control may conflict with efforts to try to enhance the operation to conserve energy. For example, moisture management and humidity control needs systems to be set to supply make-up air at lower temperature levels (design levels), instead of the greater temperatures sometimes used to save energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions. Nevertheless, for most of the US and many parts of Europe and Japan, during most of hours of the year, outdoor air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not require additional cooling to supply thermal convenience inside your home. However, high humidity outdoors develops the need for mindful attention to humidity levels inside. High humidities generate mold development and wetness indoors is related to a higher occurrence of occupant breathing issues.<p>
