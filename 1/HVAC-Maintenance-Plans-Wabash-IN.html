<p>An indoor air contaminant is a compound in the air that may affect the health of people who reside in the home.

An air contaminant could likewise come from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a defective furnace, volatile natural substances (VOCs) from a newly painted room, pre-owned smoke, mold growing on damp or wet carpets, or chemicals from pastimes, household cleaning, or personal care products. Bacteria and infections, animal dander, and pest parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air toxins.<p>

If one or more of these processes are underperforming, the quality of indoor air will be impacted.<p>
