<p>Regular maintenance keeps a furnace working effectively, according to HVAC professionals like Dave Mejean of B&W Pipes & Heating in Indianapolis. When you're running an HVAC company, you're on board for all the ups and downs that come with owning a high-demand, seasonal company. A thoroughly crafted business plan for an HVAC company is the first step to manage those peaks and lulls so your earnings remain healthy year-round. If you didn't produce a heating and cooling service plan when you started your company, it's not too late to develop one now, or to give your initial plan an update.<p>
<p>In 1995, Germany made CFC refrigerators unlawful. 30 DuPont and other companies blocked the refrigerant in the U.S. with the U.S. EPA, disparaging the technique as "that German innovation". 29 31 Nevertheless, in 2004, Greenpeace dealt with multinational corporations like Coca-Cola and Unilever, and later Pepsico and others, to produce a business coalition called Refrigerants Naturally!. 30 32 Then, 4 years later, Ben & Jerry's of Unilever and General Electric began to take actions to support production and usage in the U.S. 33 In 2011 the EPA decided in favor of the ozone- and climate-safe refrigerant for U.S. manufacture. 25 34 35 HFCs like R-410a, r-134a and r-404a are, since 2020, being changed with HFO and hydrocarbon refrigerants like R-1234ze in chillers for commercial refigeration and a/c, R-1234yf in cars, R-32 in residential air conditioning and CO2 (R-744) in commercial refrigeration. R-600 (isobutane) is already commonly used in residential refrigeration.<p>
