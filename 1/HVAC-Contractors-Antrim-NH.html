<h3>A Synopsis of Central Heating Systems in Antrim NH</h3>
<p>I have been using Waychoff for about 10 years. Initially, they fixed a bad installation from a previous company. Afterwards, they have maintained my system semi-annually.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help identify the efficiency of dilution. Air changes result from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate moisture. The objective is to provide enough changes to guarantee a healthy environment. There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be set up to achieve this. A common aspect needed in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) offers guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
