<p>Regular maintenance keeps a furnace working efficiently, according to HVAC experts like Dave Mejean of B&W Plumbing & Heating in Indianapolis.

If your system is near, or past, its expected lifespan, replacement might be the most cost-efficient solution.<p>

<p>Outdoor contaminants. Outside particulates can be drawn inside when the heating or cooling system draws air into a house. Particulates and irritants discovered in outside air can be asthma triggers. Filtering inbound air for HVAC systems successfully filters particulates.
