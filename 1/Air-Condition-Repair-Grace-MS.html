<h3>Heat Pumps and Indoor Air Quality at Grace MS</h3>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps are incredibly effective, due to the fact that ground source heating is drawn out from depths where the temperature is constantly at a constant temperature.

Much like other kinds of heatpump, ground source heatpump have their geothermal performance rated according to their coefficient of efficiency (POLICE OFFICER).

That's since it cools the air so quickly that it shuts off prior to it has a possibility to circulate the correct volume of air past the coils to extract the needed moisture. The result is a room that does not appear as cool as the temperature shows. In truth, the space can feel clammy and wet.<p>
