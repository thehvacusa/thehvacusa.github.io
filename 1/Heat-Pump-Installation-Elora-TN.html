<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't successful you wouldn't use them.. Second of all like extended automobile guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the necessary abilities to do the job and likewise the morals to treat consumers relatively.

Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally found someone to appropriately service and the unit has actually been running problem totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
