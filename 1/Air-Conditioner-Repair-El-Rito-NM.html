<p>Weatherization generally does not trigger indoor air issues by adding brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases produce contaminants.) Nevertheless, measures such as setting up storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the quantity of outside air penetrating into a home. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that release gases or particles into the air are the main cause of indoor air quality issues. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor toxin levels by not bringing in sufficient outside air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air pollutants out of the location. Heat and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
