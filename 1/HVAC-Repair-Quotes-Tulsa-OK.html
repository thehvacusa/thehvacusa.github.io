<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company because the two technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
