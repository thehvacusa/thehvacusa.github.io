<p>Learn about PSR Mechanical. The efficiency of an air cleaner depends on how well it gathers contaminants from indoor air (revealed as a percentage performance rate) and just how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering component (revealed in cubic feet per minute). A very effective collector with a low air-circulation rate will not be effective, nor will a cleaner with a high air-circulation rate but a less effective collector. The long-term performance of any air cleaner depends upon keeping it according to the producer's directions.<p>
<p>A ducted heatpump appears like a large central air conditioning conditioner system that sits outside your house. Heat pumps work on electrical energy and work like ac system in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outside air.

They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>
