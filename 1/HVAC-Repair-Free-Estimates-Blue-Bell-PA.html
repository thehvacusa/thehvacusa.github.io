<p>WE ARE LIKEWISE USING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe in between the water pipe getting in and the water pipe leaving the traditional water heater. Set up a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard hot water heater are open, water will flow from the solar storage tank to the traditional water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the pipes going into and the water pipe leaving the traditional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar storage tank past the standard hot water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summertime when water temperatures are high, and the conventional hot water heater can be turned off entirely.<p>
