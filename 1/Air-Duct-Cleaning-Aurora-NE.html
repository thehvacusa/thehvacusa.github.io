<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Sound considering that 1978. The selection of indoor units has one limitation: their overall power should not go beyond the capacity of the outside unit. In practice, nevertheless, it is extremely typical to see a multi-split system with an overall capability of indoor systems greater than the outdoor capability by at least 20%. Nevertheless, it is incorrect to anticipate much better performance when all indoor systems are turned on at the very same time, since the overall capacity of the whole system is limited by the capability of the outdoor unit.

<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is basic. Heat increases, so it makes good sense to find the heat source at the floor level. This lets the warmth naturally take a trip through the hot" zone, which is from a person's toe to head area. All items in the hot zone reach equilibrium in temperature after the radiant heat system has been operating for a while, including people. When the furnace kicks in and that unexpected shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>
