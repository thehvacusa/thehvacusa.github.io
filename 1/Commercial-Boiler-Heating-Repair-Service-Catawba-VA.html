<p>As soon as the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high sufficient temperature, a blower fan will start to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger allows air to be heated up without coming in contact with the actual flame or burner area. Once it reaches an adequate temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the home's duct, supplying warm air to specific bedrooms, living rooms and kitchen areas through the vents or signs up.<p>
