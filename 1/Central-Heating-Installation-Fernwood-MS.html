<p>WE ARE LIKEWISE OFFERING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL CONVENIENCE ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe in between the pipes entering and the water pipe leaving the conventional water heater. Install a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard hot water heater are open, water will stream from the solar storage tank to the standard hot water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the pipes entering and the pipes leaving the standard water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar storage tank past the traditional water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer season when water temperature levels are high, and the standard hot water heater can be turned off completely.<p>

A steam boiler replacement costs in between $4,000 and $30,000, depending upon boiler size.<p>
