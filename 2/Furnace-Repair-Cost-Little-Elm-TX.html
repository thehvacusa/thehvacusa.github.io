<p>Furnaces are like vehicles. As they age, you can change one part just need another part replaced or repaired next year. It does not take long to spend $500 simply to keep an old oil or gas furnace running. Heaters incur the most breakdowns in the last 2 years of their lives. Another repair sign is whether you needed to wait to get parts changed. As a furnace ages, it gets more difficult to source replacement parts. Waiting that can be truly cold on a below zero night.<p>
