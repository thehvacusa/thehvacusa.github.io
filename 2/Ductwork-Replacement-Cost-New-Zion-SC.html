<p>When the heatpump went out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was very practical in collecting information on the phone and supplying clear guidelines about how to briefly handle the problem and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely efficient and used clear interaction about the problem, its remedies, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will definitely use Integrity Energy Systems once again, for workplace and home.<p>
