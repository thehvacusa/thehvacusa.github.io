Typical sources of VOCs inside consist of things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as seemingly innocuous as a new carpet is most likely to be releasing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors could consist of volatile chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled inside during water usage.<p>
