<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't successful you wouldn't use them.. Second of all like extended auto guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the necessary abilities to do the job and also the morals to deal with consumers relatively. As a consumer you need to be well informed in order not to be totally benefited from. Many companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Finally discovered somebody to properly service and the system has actually been operating problem complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
