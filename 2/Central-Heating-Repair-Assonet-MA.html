<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
