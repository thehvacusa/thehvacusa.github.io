<p>There is a transformer in your air conditioning furnace. The transformer is what supplies 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. If your transformer breakdowns, your Nest will not come on. Your transformer transforms the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends out power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency safety switches that protect your cooling system from flooding. One of the most common places for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety changes is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. If your Nest is showing a blank screen, it is a likelihood; you might have a water leakage in the attic. The water activates your emergency security switch, hence cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This shuts down all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is also a baseplate that links to the Nest. We have seen baseplate go bad on rare events.<p>
