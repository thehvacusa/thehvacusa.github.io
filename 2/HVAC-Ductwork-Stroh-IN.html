<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
