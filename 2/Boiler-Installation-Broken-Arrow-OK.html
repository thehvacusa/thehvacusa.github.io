People also react extremely in a different way to exposure to indoor air contaminants. Additional research is needed to much better understand which health results take place after direct exposure to the typical toxin concentrations discovered in houses and which occur from the higher concentrations that take place for short time periods.<p>
<p>Biological impurities consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these toxins. Pollens originate from plants; infections are transmitted by animals and individuals; bacteria are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and home pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a powerful allergen. It can become airborne when it dries. Contaminated central air conditioning handling systems can end up being breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then distribute these impurities through the house.<p>
