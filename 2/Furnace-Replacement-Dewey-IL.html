<h3>Furnace Company in Dewey IL</h3>
<p>AC units and thermostats have built-in hold-up functions when they're closed down and after that repowered. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes.

<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company since the two service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
