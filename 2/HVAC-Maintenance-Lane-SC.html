The practical heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature of the inbound air is decreased, however it is also more humid, so the total heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. A few of the sensible heat of the going into air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the results can be quite substantial.<p>
