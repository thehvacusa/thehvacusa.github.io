<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often receives ask for assessment and assistance in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. Throughout the 1970s, numerous property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation step. However, many of these homes were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was set up several years back are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
