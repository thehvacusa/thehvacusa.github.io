He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call company several years back and understand the significance of having the best parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also amazed that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be utilizing Waycoff's again, and would suggest them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
