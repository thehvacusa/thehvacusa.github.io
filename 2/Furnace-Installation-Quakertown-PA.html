<h3>How To Prevent Costly HVAC Emergency Service Calls in Quakertown PA</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was fast and very clear about his inspection, ensuring I comprehended what was watched out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So maybe a little steep on price for this service, but the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
<p>Check these 3 things initially if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the registers in your house are large open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go tidy and outside off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If a number of registers were closed or the filter was obstructed, the minimized airflow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. Deice the A-coil if you have actually altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or up until there's good airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've solved the issue.<p>
