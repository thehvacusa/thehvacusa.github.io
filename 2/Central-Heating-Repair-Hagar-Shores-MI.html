<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has actually been shown to cause cancer in animals.

Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve cash by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical during the pressing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to minimize your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up, do decline them till they have actually been appropriately dried.
