<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Watch out for indications of water leaks or flooding to stop mold from growing. Permeable materials, flooring, wall, and ceiling coverings, and furnishings discovered in the basements that have actually been wet for over 24 to 48 hours may become a source for mold growth and need to be discarded. Sometimes there is a musty odor but mold can not be seen. Mold does not need light to grow and can grow in hidden or seldom accessed locations of your home, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a range of surface areas: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on flooring products consisting of carpet underpadding. Opportunities are there will be mold growing close by if a source of water or condensation can be discovered. Repair the wetness issue, either by locating the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the area. Completely tidy the area utilizing established health department recommendations.<p>
