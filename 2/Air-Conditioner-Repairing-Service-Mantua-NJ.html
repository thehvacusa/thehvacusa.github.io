<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser unit utilizing refrigerant piping in between an indoor and outdoor  unit instead of ducting air directly from the outdoor unit. Indoor systems with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor units install inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct deal with air from the indoor system to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
