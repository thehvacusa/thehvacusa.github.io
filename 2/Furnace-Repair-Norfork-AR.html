<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds astounding, but furnace service technicians often discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Search for a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Examine the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be completely depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
