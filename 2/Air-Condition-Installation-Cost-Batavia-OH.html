From one of the most standard, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the larger, 4-inch media filter typically in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more advanced electronic air cleaners and air cleansers, all need some fundamental maintenance. These filters aid with indoor air quality by trapping airborne contaminants streaming through your system.
