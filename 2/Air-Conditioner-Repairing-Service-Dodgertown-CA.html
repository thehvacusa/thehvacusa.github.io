<p>Indoor Air Quality Guide: Best Practices for Style, Building And Construction and Commissioning is developed for designers, design engineers, contractors, commissioning representatives, and all other professionals worried about indoor air quality. Sources of formaldehyde in the house consist of structure materials, smoking cigarettes, family items, and making use of unvented, fuel-burning devices, like gas stoves or kerosene space heating units. Formaldehyde, by itself or in combination with other chemicals, serves a number of purposes in produced products. For instance, it is used to include permanent-press qualities to clothes and drapes, as a component of glues and adhesives, and as a preservative in some paints and covering products.<p>
