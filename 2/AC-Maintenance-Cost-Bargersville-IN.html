<p>Current Review: They were fantastic! So many HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to supply you with the service originally asked for. They met my requirements entirely by providing an expert quote with options, without pressing additional items. The team appeared on time, kept me informed as they worked, and ended up a little early. The likewise promptly followed up with the needed assessments from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely recommend this company.<p>
<p>After the system has been checked for leakages, thoroughly insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with basic foam pipeline insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers need to be insulated with fiberglass pipe insulation. Duct tape can be used on the joints of the water piping insulation, and use the joint tape that features fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunlight can be protected by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation used outside must be secured with PVC insulation covers.<p>
