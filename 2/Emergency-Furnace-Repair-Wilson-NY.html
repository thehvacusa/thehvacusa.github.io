<p>Both the condenser and the evaporator are sealed. For that reason, an expert service person ought to be required almost any maintenance other than routine cleaning. Central air conditioners should be expertly inspected and changed before the start of every cooling season. Nevertheless, don't let your maintenance end with this annual examination.
