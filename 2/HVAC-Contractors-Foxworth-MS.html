<h3>Factors to Consider When Searching for a Good AC Repair Company at Foxworth MS</h3>
<p>A lot of residential heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The current pattern in home building is to reduce air leakage through fractures and other openings in roofing systems, floors, and walls. The combination of these building and construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has resulted in an increase in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside make-up air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living locations of residential structures. The ASHRAE guidelines for make-up air for bathroom and kitchens in houses are much greater. This fresh make-up air waters down indoor contaminants and helps tire them from the home.<p>
