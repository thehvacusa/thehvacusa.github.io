<p>We needed two visits - Jake came out initially and was enjoyable and really experienced and respectful. Grant came out a couple days later on and was also well-informed and good to talk to. They both did a great task. Sabre's office personnel is extremely handy, calling prior to the arrival of the technician, and providing the technician's name and approximate arrival time. They are also well priced for their services. Absolutely recommend.<p>
<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and after that measure the height and width of the opening. When shopping for an air conditioner to guarantee it'll fit easily into the window, be sure to have those dimensions on hand. Also, keep fire security in mind when deciding where to set up the air conditioning system: Don't put it in an egress window that acts as the only ways of escape must a fire emerge.<p>
<p>Inadequate maintenance of the HVAC system also may add to indoor air quality issues. Ventilation system filters that are not changed regularly may end up being clogged, decreasing air circulation quality, distribution, and volume. They also might end up being locations for germs and molds to be and grow distributed throughout the house. Humidifier systems on HVAC systems also must be properly kept to avoid bacteria and mold contamination.<p>
