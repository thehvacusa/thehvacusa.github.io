The energy effectiveness of central air units is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions.

The typical set conditions are outdoor temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why many people don't utilize this measurement much anymore.<p>
