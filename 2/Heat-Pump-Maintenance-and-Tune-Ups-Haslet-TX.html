<h3>Central Air Conditioning System in Haslet Texas</h3>
<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The unit runs quietly and effectively, but to have two major components fail in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (defrost control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were noted on the billing before work started. Parts were covered by warranty. Tax added another $53. The work was finished in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>Some illness, like humidifier fever, are associated with direct exposure to contaminants from bacteria that can grow in big structure ventilation systems. However, these illness can likewise be traced to microbes that grow in home heating and cooling systems and humidifiers.
