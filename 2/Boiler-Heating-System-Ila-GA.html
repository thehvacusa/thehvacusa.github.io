<p>It is common to presume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively steady with time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a structure as fairly the same physical material in time. In reality, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research study using the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
