<h3>Things to Look for in an AC Heating Repair Service in Pigeon Forge TN</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government firm, performed a research study in the 1990s to examine 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy costs by improving air flow. After checking 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy efficiency. In many cases, measured particle levels actually increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced right away after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
