<p>Air conditioning can likewise be offered by a procedure called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is included because the temperature level of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, therefore declining its efficiency.<p>
