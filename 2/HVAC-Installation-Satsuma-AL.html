<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil modification' type of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'might' cause an issue in the future. So he stated I might switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is typically a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt once again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, because something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
