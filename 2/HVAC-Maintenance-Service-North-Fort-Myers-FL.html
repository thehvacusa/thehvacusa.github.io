<p>We look at clues prior to we offer advice to replace rather than repair a heating system. One of the ideas we look at is the cost of energy. If energy expenses are high compared to use, or if energy costs are higher year after year, we know the unit is not running efficiently.

<p>The main factor property owners do not acquire an HVAC service contract is the cost. They can cost in between $150 and $500 per year, depending on the quantity of services used. The cost might not be worthwhile if the system is brand-new and still under a maker's service warranty. Any significant repairs should be covered under the maker's warranty. However, some producers require routine maintenance as a term of the service warranty.<p>
