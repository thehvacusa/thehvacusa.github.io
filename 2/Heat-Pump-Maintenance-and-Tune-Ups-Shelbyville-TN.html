<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (most of the times) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is currently GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad need to be GFCI protected.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and annoyance breaker journeys.
