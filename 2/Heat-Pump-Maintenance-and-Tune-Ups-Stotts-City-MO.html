<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have become aware of the $5000 rule but got ta provide whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one inside and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just crazy and all over the place and I guess they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
