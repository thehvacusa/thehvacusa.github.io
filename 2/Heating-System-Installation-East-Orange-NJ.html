<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning aid figure out the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications result from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning occurs when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of moisture. The goal is to offer enough changes to make sure a healthy environment. There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be installed to achieve this. A typical component essential in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) offers guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
