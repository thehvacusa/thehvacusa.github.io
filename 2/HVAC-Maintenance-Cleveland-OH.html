<p>We look at clues prior to we offer recommendations to change rather than repair a heating system. Among the ideas we look at is the cost of energy. If energy expenses are high compared to usage, or if energy bills are higher every year, we understand the unit is not running efficiently. It may be in ideal condition, but if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to replace it with a more effective model, then you would be losing cash by not changing the older unit.<p>
<p>A third way to decide whether your home may have poor indoor air quality is to take a look at your way of life and activities. Human activities can be significant sources of indoor air contamination. Finally, try to find signs of problems with the ventilation in your home. Indications that can suggest your home may not have sufficient ventilation consist of moisture condensation on walls or windows, stuffy or smelly air, filthy central heating and air cooling devices, and locations where books, shoes, or other items end up being musty. To spot odors in your home, step outside for a few minutes, and after that upon reentering your home, note whether odors are obvious.<p>
<p>Advanced designs of new homes are starting to include mechanical systems that bring outside air into the home. A few of these styles include energy-efficient heat recovery ventilators (also called air-to-air heat exchangers).
