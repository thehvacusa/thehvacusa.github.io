<h3>Air Conditioner Reviews in Goffstown New Hampshire</h3>
<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00. (He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this man belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the home.<p>

<h3>HVAC Maintenance Near Me in Goffstown NH</h3>
<p>Ducted heatpump heating and cooling systems act just like traditional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces by means of a duct system. A ducted heat pump system may be most economical if your home or structure has an existing duct system that remains in good condition. Utilizing existing ductwork will get rid of the need to set up an expensive brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
