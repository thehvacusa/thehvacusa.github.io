AC contactors can break and are at the top of the list of typical a/c service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every five years or two.

<p>A specific air conditioner that is used just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also uses a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a standard air conditioning system in that both the evaporator and the condenser are placed in the exact same air path. Because its condenser coil releases heat outside, a basic air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the space. However, since all parts of the dehumidifier remain in the exact same room, no heat energy is removed. Rather, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier stays in the room as heat, so the space is in fact heated up, just as by an electric heater that draws the exact same amount of power.<p>
