<p>Due to the present Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The capability to cool and heat your house at maximum efficiency will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is presently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot house will need a much larger AC unit than a smaller sized home, which will impact installation expenses. Likewise a house with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no cracks for air flow will need far less AC capacity to keep temperature levels comfy. Other factors that can impact this could be the insulation in other places such as the structure, roofing system, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
<p>Both the evaporator and the condenser are sealed. For that reason, a professional service person ought to be required nearly any maintenance besides routine cleaning.
