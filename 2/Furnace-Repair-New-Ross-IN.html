Due to the fact that they do not need any new ductwork to be installed, ductless heat pumps are fantastic for additions. Because an unit is set up in each room or location you want to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensors that instantly raise the temperature in the space when you exist.<p>
