<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may believe. Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive flexible pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to wear and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
<p>Ron, the owner, reached out to me concerning an unusually high bill that I got blindsided by BEFORE he knew that I had called the service supervisor and left a message of concern. Ron had found the difficulty location in examining the expense. He solved the problem in one day, had actually adjusted the expense to what I thought about fair prior to he called back, knew what might have caused the issue and had a plan to guarantee that it would not take place once again. I have actually considered All Points a company with integrity for the nine years we have utilized them. This experience validates that.<p>
