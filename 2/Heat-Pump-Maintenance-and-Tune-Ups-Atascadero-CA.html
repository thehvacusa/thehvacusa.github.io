<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to vaporize, for this reason the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it takes in heat from the within air, go back to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. At the same time, heat is taken in from inside and moved outdoors, resulting in cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help figure out the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications result from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of moisture, Air cleaning takes place. The objective is to offer adequate modifications to guarantee a healthy environment. There are a number of kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to accomplish this. A typical aspect essential in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) offers assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
