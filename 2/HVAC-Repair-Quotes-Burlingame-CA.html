<p>If you use an unvented kerosene or gas space heating unit, think about potential impacts of indoor air contamination. Follow the manufacturer's directions, especially guidelines on the appropriate fuel and keeping the heating unit appropriately adjusted.

While a space heating unit remains in usage, open a door from the space where the heating system lies to the remainder of the home and open a window a little.<p>
