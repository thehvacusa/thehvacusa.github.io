<p>Truth: Geothermal systems actually take in no water. All the water is returned to that very same aquifer if an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth.

<h3>Choosing the Proper Company For Heating and AC Systems at Hopland CA</h3>
<p>Geothermal heatpump are extremely efficient, since ground source heating is drawn out from depths where the temperature level is always at a constant temperature level. These systems can achieve a geothermal effectiveness of about 300 to 600 percent throughout the, Coldest winter season nights; whereas air-source heat pumps can just achieve a performance of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter season. Just like other kinds of heat pumps, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal efficiency rated according to their coefficient of efficiency (POLICE). COP rates just how much heat a system removes or produces (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system uses to produce the heating or cooling impact. Many ground source heat pumps have COPs of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this indicates is that for each unit of energy utilized by a geothermal heatpump, around 3 to 5 units are supplied back in the form of heat.<p>
