<p>I am changing our High Speed System due to the fact that of a major refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be using the above noted equipment, a Carrier, Comfort Series Single Stage Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are also installing an Unico single Phase Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be including three (3) high velocity supply lines and reuse the existing 17 supply lines. They will also recycle the refrigerant lines and leave the R-11 refrigerant and replace with a R410 refrigerant. They will also install a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I likewise have an option for an extra $2,818.00 to install a Carrier Performance Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both rated at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>Nick B. supplied remarkable, tailored, attentive, and quality service. His interaction design is friendly, effective and interesting. He plainly and completely discussed all problems and fixes in a manner that made me positive in his capability to resolve my repair problems. He followed through and went the extra mile to personally pick up a needed part that was not in stock, making sure repairs were made so that my other half and I would not need to endure another night without heat, during one of the coldest winters in current memory. He also responded to my call immediately the next early morning, and coached me through a momentary fix to a problem that couldn't be fixed on the very first check out due to unavailable parts. I rely on Nick's skills, experience and ability to provide consistent, quality service.<p>
<p>As many of you mentioned, preventative maintenance is required by all significant equipment manufacturer's to guarantee your factory warranties remain in place. In addition, the concrete results of a PM is often hard to quantify, as one response stated the cost savings in effectiveness or repairs that were prevented. Most pieces of a furnace or air conditioning unit do not just break at the snap of a finger, however rather is the outcome of repetitive use of a part that is out of balance. For example, a heat exchanger might stop working too soon because the gas pressure was running to high, preparing the metal and triggering premature degeneration, causing holes and cracks. , if that client had actually gotten a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure remains in line and safeguards the part.. a very beneficial outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that possibly saved a client thousands.<p>
