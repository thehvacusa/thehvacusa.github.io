<h3>The Basics of Central Heating and Air Conditioning in Morning View KY</h3>
<p>Ductless a/c is, naturally, suitable for homes without ducts, however is also a flexible option for a variety of other situations.

Extremely economical, and energy-efficient, and supplying greater control over when and where the air enters your house, All Points Heating can assist you select the best ductless a/c system for your requirements.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
