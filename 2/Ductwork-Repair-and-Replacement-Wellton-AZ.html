<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is often in the series of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), since heatpump become inefficient in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system must temporarily switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
