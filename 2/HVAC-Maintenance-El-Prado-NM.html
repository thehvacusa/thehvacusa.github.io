<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor workplace, classroom or lab environments, as opposed to outdoor or commercial settings.

<p>Luis was instantly responsive to email and texts with questions. He committed to the job based only on e-mails, showed up and delivered with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs offer was one of the couple of affordable ones got. Others were nearly two times the amount Protex estimated for low end off brand equipment. I got Carrier.

<p>Open windows or use exhaust fans. Ventilation, a typical technique of decreasing direct exposure to indoor air toxins, also will reduce but not eliminate direct exposure to environmental tobacco smoke. Mechanical or natural ventilation strategies do not remove them from the air in your home as quickly as they build up because smoking produces such large quantities of toxins. In addition, the large boosts in ventilation it takes to substantially decrease exposure to ecological tobacco smoke can likewise increase energy expenses significantly. Consequently, the most efficient way to lower direct exposure to environmental tobacco smoke in the home is to get rid of smoking cigarettes there.<p>
