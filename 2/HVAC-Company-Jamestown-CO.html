<p>Free cooling systems can have very high effectiveness, and are often integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be utilized for summer cooling. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in due to the fact that the storage serves as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, triggering the temperature to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>

<p>An indoor air toxin is a compound in the air that might affect the health of people who live in the house. Contaminants might originate from outside the house-- such as an idling automobile engine in a connected garage, backyard garbage burning, or radon getting in the house from the ground listed below. An air contaminant could also originate from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a malfunctioning furnace, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from a newly painted space, pre-owned smoke, mold growing on wet or wet carpets, or chemicals from pastimes, family cleaning, or personal care items. Bacteria and infections, pet dander, and pest parts (dust mites or roaches) are other possible indoor air contaminants.<p>

According to figures gathered by Angie's List, house owners can expect to pay between $6 and $16 per square foot, not including tax and labor, for a radiant heat system.)
