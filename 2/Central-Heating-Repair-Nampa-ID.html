<p>It prevails to assume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly stable gradually. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a building as relatively unchanged physical material gradually. In truth, the true nature of structures can be considered as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and comprehended as intricate systems. Research study using the methods ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
