A standard air conditioning system transfers heat energy out of the space since its condenser coil launches heat outside. Nevertheless, since all elements of the dehumidifier are in the exact same space, no heat energy is gotten rid of. Rather, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier stays in the room as heat, so the space is actually warmed, simply as by an electric heating unit that draws the same amount of power.<p>
