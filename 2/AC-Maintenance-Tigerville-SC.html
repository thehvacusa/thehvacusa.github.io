<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to vaporize, for this reason the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator.

In the process, heat is absorbed from inside and moved outdoors, resulting in cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your car's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine could damage the engine components. To avoid this from happening, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator needs managed by professionals, visit Acme Car Electric & Repair today.<p>
