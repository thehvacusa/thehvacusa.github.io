<p>Details supplied in this safety guide is based upon present scientific and technical understanding of the concerns presented and is reflective of the jurisdictional limits established by the statutes governing the co-authoring agencies. The requirements do not need you to change your existing central air conditioning systems, and replacement parts and services must still be available for your home's systems. The "life-span" of a central air conditioner is about 15 to twenty years. Makers typically continue to support existing devices by making replacement parts offered and honoring maintenance contracts after the new standard enters into effect.<p>
<p>There are lots of things to consider when attempting to figure out how frequently I must replace my cooling filters. Every Houston Heights 77007 77008 home has an unique DNA on how it accumulates dust and dirt. It takes about 6 months of close observation to see how often your air conditioning filter gathers dirt and dust. After that, you can make a better right decision on how often your HVAC filters need changing. Some Houston Midtown 77003 77004 homes have more than one HVAC filter, like townhouses. The more air filters you have in your Houston Galleria 77055 77056 77057 house, the less often you'll have to clean them. Houston Montrose 77006 77098 houses with only one cooling filter need changing more often.<p>
