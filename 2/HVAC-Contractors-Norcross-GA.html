Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can save money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pressing and completing procedures. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to reduce your exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them up until they have actually been correctly dried if dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical odor when you select them up. Try a different dry cleaner if items with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent visits.<p>
