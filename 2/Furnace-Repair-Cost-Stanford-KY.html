<p>Inspect these three things first if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Ensure all the signs up in the house are wide open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go tidy and outdoors off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If several signs up were closed or the filter was blocked, the reduced airflow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. If you have actually altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or until there's good air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. You have actually fixed the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
