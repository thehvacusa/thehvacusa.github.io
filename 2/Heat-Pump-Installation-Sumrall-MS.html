<p>The effects of lead exposure on fetuses and children can be severe. They include hold-ups in physical and psychological advancement, lower IQ levels, reduced attention periods, and increased behavioral problems. Babies, children, and fetuses are more susceptible to lead direct exposure than grownups since lead is more quickly absorbed into growing bodies, and the tissues of children are more sensitive to the harmful effects of lead. Kids might have higher direct exposures because they are most likely to get lead dust on their hands and then put their fingers or other lead-contaminated items into their mouths.<p>
