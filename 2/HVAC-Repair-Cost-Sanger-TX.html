<p>Today's house convected heat systems take full advantage of infrared radiation. By far, the most common source of a radiator in a home is the floor mass. Radiators can be in your area located in one location like a restroom flooring or be set up across the whole sub-surface of the home's floors. Other radiators are still utilized, such as wall-mounted panels or baseboard heating units-- although ceiling radiators are almost always utilized in commercial applications like warehouses.<p>
<p>This is especially noteworthy, as gas stoves can cause levels of contamination that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with poorly adjusted gas stoves can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>
<p>Usually the most effective method to enhance indoor air quality is to remove private sources of contamination or to minimize their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas stoves, can be adjusted to reduce the amount of emissions. In a lot of cases, source control is also a more cost-effective technique to protecting indoor air quality than increasing ventilation since increasing ventilation can increase energy expenses.
