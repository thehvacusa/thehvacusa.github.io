<p>Cooling can also be supplied by a process called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is included because the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, thereby decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
<p>In addition to getting the huge picture" of your indoor air quality, an indoor air quality display can be established to provide threshold notifies. If, for instance, the outside air has a CO2 level of 400 ppm, you might set up your monitoring devices to signal you when indoor levels reach 950, and when the air has reached crucial point at 1100 ppm. From there you can take the suitable action to solve the circumstance right away.<p>
