<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a need for air conditioner repair, which you should watch out for. Initially, you ought to examine your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly if totally iced over.<p>
