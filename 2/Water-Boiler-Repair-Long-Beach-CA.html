<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the vehicle debit, although my company does not use car debit lots of companies do so they can have a known amount of cash being available in on a monthly basis, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. , if we do choose to offer auto debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.. There need to not be any reason that your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
