<p>The function of the majority of building ventilation systems is to bring in appropriate fresh air for occupant comfort while controlling temperature level, humidity, and indoor air quality for workers and building safety at reasonable energy costs. Load determining is referred to as the Manual J computation and need to be performed by the HVAC contractor prior to giving an installation or system cost for a/c. Move to another contractor if your contractor says they know the size of air conditioning system you need based on experience or on square video footage alone. Just like determining the size of an unit required based on BTUs, identifying the appropriate size of unit for your house also depends on the unit load-- just how much cold air it will lose by space.<p>

<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (for the most part) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is already GFCI secured like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad should be GFCI safeguarded.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and annoyance breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we chose to set up a dedicated circuit with its own wiring and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are available.<p>
