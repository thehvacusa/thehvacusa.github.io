<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding job finding the outside system as close to your home as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my backyard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was very well-informed of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
