<p>The quality of the air inside our work environments, schools and homes matters, especially since we invest the majority of our lives indoors. Ac system assist to dehumidify the inbound air, but in very humid climates or in cases where the air conditioning unit is oversized, it might not attain a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and because the a/c unit will need more energy to cool your home. A more effective option is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be added as a retrofit to a lot of existing systems.<p>
<p>Truth: Federal and local rewards generally amount to in between 30 and 60 percent of total geothermal system cost, which can often make the preliminary cost of a system competitive with traditional equipment.

Geothermal HVAC systems start at about $5,000 per load, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per heap. Nevertheless, new installation practices are reducing expenses, to the point where the cost is getting closer to conventional systems under the right conditions.<p>
