<p>If you think a mold issue-- either since of noticeable growth or a moldy smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it does not get rid of the mold. Mold begins with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and maintain. Leaky return ducts can likewise introduce moisture. Again, if you think a mold issue, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>
<p>The EPA and CMHC researchers used different methodologies. The CMHC study called on several duct-cleaning services. The companies were not made aware they were part of a study, and the scientists did not control for time invested or methods used. The EPA research study prescribed and controlled methods utilized on a smaller number of homes. While the duct-cleaning market argues both studies have defects, no other research study has challenged the findings. And although the equipment and approaches utilized by duct-cleaning companies have actually altered considering that these studies were performed, the air ducts in homes have not.<p>

Before choosing whether to repair or change your condenser and blower units, your technician ought to run a duct-leakage test, by sealing the vents and determining just how much air gets away the system.<p>
