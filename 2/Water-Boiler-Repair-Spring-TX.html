<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones, the main issue. While installing a different split system, workers attempt to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system produces more troubles, given that a few of indoor systems can be located far from the exterior. The very first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not permit you to set the cooling individually for each room. However, now the marketplace has a wide selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional attributes of indoor units run separately from each other.<p>
