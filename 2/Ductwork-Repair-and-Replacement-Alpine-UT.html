<h3>Residential and Commercial HVAC Services in Alpine UT</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government firm, conducted a research study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it lowers energy expenses by improving air flow. After testing 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no considerable enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy efficiency. In many cases, measured particle levels really increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>

As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
