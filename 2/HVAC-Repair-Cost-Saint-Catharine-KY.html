Operating on electrical power, a heatpump is an economical solution using a refrigeration cycle like that which cools your refrigerator, but in reverse.

Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heat systems operate on comparable concepts. When it comes to a boiler, the system heats by dispersing hot water through a series of pipes installed in the sub-floor of each space. In the case of electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components. As the hot water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the floor and into the room.<p>

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the automobile debit, although my company does not offer auto debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of money coming in every month, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. , if we do decide to use car debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Agreement..
