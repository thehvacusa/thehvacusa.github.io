<h3>Wall Air Conditioner in Oak Grove Arkansas</h3>
<p>My "C" ranking is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The system runs silently and effectively, but to have two major components stop working in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (thaw control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were listed on the billing before work began. Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax added another $53. The work was finished in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
