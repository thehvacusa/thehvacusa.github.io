<p>An indoor air pollutant is a substance in the air that may affect the health of individuals who live in the house. Pollutants could originate from outside the house-- such as an idling vehicle engine in an attached garage, yard garbage burning, or radon getting in your house from the ground listed below. An air pollutant might likewise originate from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide from a malfunctioning furnace, unstable natural substances (VOCs) from a newly painted space, pre-owned smoke, mold growing on wet or moist carpets, or chemicals from pastimes, household cleaning, or individual care products. Bacteria and infections, animal dander, and insect parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air contaminants.<p>
<p>Central air conditioning is a high-end not everyone can pay for, so many Seattleites must find ways to fight the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in action to a heat advisory from the National Weather Service. On the other hand, in huge box stores like Best Buy, package fans and window AC units are snatched up as soon as they're stacked in floor displays.

<p>Carbon monoxide (CO) is an odorless, colorless harmful gas. Due to the fact that it is difficult to see, taste or smell, CO can eliminate you before you are aware it is in your house. At lower levels of direct exposure, CO triggers moderate impacts that are frequently mistaken for the influenza. These symptoms include headaches, lightheadedness, tiredness, nausea and disorientation. The effects of CO direct exposure can vary considerably from person to person depending on age, general health and the concentration and length of direct exposure.<p>
