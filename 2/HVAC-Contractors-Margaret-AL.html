<p>The quality of the air inside our offices, schools and houses matters, especially considering that we spend most of our lives indoors. Air conditioning unit help to dehumidify the incoming air, but in incredibly humid climates or in cases where the a/c is oversized, it might not accomplish a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and due to the fact that the air conditioning unit will require more energy to cool your house.

<p>Geothermal heatpump can be quickly integrated with existing systems such as conventional forced air or radiant floor heating or can be set up in a new structure.

Energy Environmental Corporation is experienced in geothermal heat pump installation and can help you properly size a system.<p>
