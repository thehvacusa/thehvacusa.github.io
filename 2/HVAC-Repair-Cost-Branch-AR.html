<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a need for air conditioner repair, which you ought to watch out for. First, you must examine your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
