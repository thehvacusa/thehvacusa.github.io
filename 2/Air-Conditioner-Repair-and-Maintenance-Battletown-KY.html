<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding task locating the outdoor system as close to your home as possible per my request. The job took 2 days and my yard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was really knowledgeable of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
