<p>It prevails to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable with time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a structure as reasonably the same physical material with time. In fact, the real nature of structures can be deemed the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
