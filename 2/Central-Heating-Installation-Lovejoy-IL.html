<p>The guidelines that included the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfortable finishing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new circuit breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We recommend you do the exact same. Once the circuitry is total, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable heats. Don't put the system into full operation till the thin-set and grout have had time to effectively harden and cure-- normally two to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm bathroom floor.<p>
