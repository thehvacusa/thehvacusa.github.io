<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding job finding the outside unit as near your house as possible per my demand. The job took 2 days and my yard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was very educated of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.)
