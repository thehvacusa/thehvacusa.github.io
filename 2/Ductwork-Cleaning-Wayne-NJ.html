<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to complete. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. As soon as I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the cost fantastic however Mark went out of his method to tailor a couple of things in my home to make the general air circulation more optimized. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>A car's coolant system transfers excess heat from one part of the engine and finally loses it through the radiator fins. With time, the coolant becomes filthy and old. The old coolant will negatively affect the system's efficiency. To make certain the system is working efficiently, think about having a routine coolant system flush. A coolant flush is standard maintenance for your automobile's cooling system. Call 206-523-2133 or visit Acme Auto Electric & Repair in Seattle, WA 98103 for all your coolant system flush and fill requirements.<p>
<p>It might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils won't give off heat efficiently and will keep the unit running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have welded together-- something that can occur gradually because of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Before checking the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This must do the trick up until you purchase a replacement-- which you ought to do quickly.<p>
