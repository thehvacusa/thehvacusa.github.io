<p>Unpredictable organic compounds (VOCs)-- These are the primary factors to poor indoor air quality; they are common both indoors and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals given off as gases from products or processes; for the many part, you can smell their presence. Common sources of VOCs indoors consist of things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as apparently innocuous as a brand-new carpet is most likely to be giving off formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors might consist of unpredictable chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled inside during water usage.<p>
<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working during times of high humidity, when there is very little dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for residence residents.
