<p>Poor indoor air quality is normally triggered by the lack of appropriate ventilation, which leads to an accumulation of contaminants from sources in the home. The National Institute for Occupational Security and Health recognized insufficient ventilation as the main issue in more than half the workplace indoor air investigations it has performed. Examinations conducted in houses by the Illinois Department of Public Health have found the exact same to be real. These examinations exposed that appropriate ventilation is important in keeping good indoor air quality.<p>
<p>The possibility of immediate responses to indoor air pollutants depends on several elements. Age and preexisting medical conditions are two essential impacts. In other cases, whether a person responds to a contaminant depends upon individual sensitivity, which varies significantly from person to person. Some people can become sensitized to biological toxins after repeated direct exposures, and it appears that some individuals can end up being sensitized to chemical pollutants too.<p>
