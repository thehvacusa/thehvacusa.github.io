<p>When they place a 24 hour emergency ac repair request, many Midtown Houston Tx customers do not know why their HVAC system is not working. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outdoors unit we'll be frozen too. Depending on how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing system, then you'll have a great concept of how thick the ice accumulation remains in the evaporator coil. The very first thing you need to do is to check your conditioning filters. If your filter is filthy, you're in luck, that's probably your issue. The next action is to thaw your air conditioning equipment if you discovered that your conditioning filter needs replacing. The easiest way to defrost your HVAC devices is to leave the unit off for a few hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
