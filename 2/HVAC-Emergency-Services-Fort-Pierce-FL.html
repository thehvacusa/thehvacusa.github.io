<p>These principles-- and determination to suffer through the heat-- may already be altering. Though only 33 percent of Seattle housing units had air conditioning in 2015, more than 46,000 new housing units have actually been built in the 4 years given that or are presently under building. The large majority of these systems are mixed-use or multi-family, where cooling is more of a market requirement, says Scott Vollmoeller of engineering company Glumac.<p>
<p>Even if your central air conditioner is just 8 to 10 years old, it might grovel twice the electricity that even a low-end brand-new one would utilize. That's due to the fact that it operates at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio, which is the quantity of energy required to supply a particular cooling output. Till 2006, 10 SEER was standard, however nowadays, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling bills than equipment set up simply a couple of years earlier.<p>
<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, indicating they use air to exchange heat, in the same method as a vehicle radiator or typical family air conditioning unit does. Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It collects water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which must be vented outside the cooled location; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled location to the outside air.<p>
