<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
