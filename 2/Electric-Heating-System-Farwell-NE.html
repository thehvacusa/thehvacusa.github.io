<p>If no pollutant sources are discovered, it is still possible that an indoor air pollution issue exists. Extreme re-circulation of air leads to "stagnant air" conditions. Stagnant air has higher levels of co2 and carbon monoxide (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outdoors air.

<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the two technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
