<p>I have been utilizing them for several years for my companies, my own homes and my real estate customers' houses. I went through five other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with various prices and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who explained to me completely the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC stopped working at my rental house. When I called and he encouraged me to get in touch with service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the system working again, he helped me trouble shoot the problem. He is sincere, trustworthy, and reasonable on cost. It's tough to discover a sincere AC person and I'm happy I found Luis. Extremely suggest Luis and his company.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
