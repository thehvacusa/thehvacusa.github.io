<h3>Ways to Get the Most From Your HVAC System in Van Nuys CA</h3>
<p>Prior to you pick a contractor, consider bids from a minimum of three to five respectable contractors. Consult your state's contractor's licensing board online to guarantee that no consumer problems have been submitted which the heating and air-conditioning contracting license is valid and active. Compare the various furnace efficiency ratings recommended by the specific contractors to select the design and system that finest suits your energy needs. Keep in mind that energy-star rated equipment will conserve you cash in the end but may involve a greater up-front cost.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is unworthy the paper it is written on. Every technician will tell you clean up the filters, take a hose twice a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Do not block the vents. Vacuum the signs up at least one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your home. Now the "hard part" once a year shut off the electricity open the furnace and extremely carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the parts, close up the cabinet put back on the electricity. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
