<h3>The History of Air Source Heat Pumps in Fort Mill SC</h3>
<p>Having a wood-burning heating system can be extremely efficient in regards to cost.

Sadly, wood-burning heater need a very crucial natural deposit: wood! Because of the quantity of wood needed to appropriately heat your entire home, wood-burning heat systems might not be excellent for the environment in spite of being carbon neutral.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the need to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
