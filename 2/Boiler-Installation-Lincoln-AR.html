<p>A geothermal heater does not generate its power by burning fossil fuels such as oil, gas, or coal. Instead, it takes in heat from within the earth. Furthermore, a geothermal heating and cooling system uses considerably less electrical energy compared to a basic electric heat-resistance heatpump. This makes a geothermal heater an appealing option to cut your carbon footprint, supplying a positive effect on the environment.<p>
<p>A geothermal heating system is more dependable than alternatives, and is not impacted by any external factors, unlike other renewable resources such as wind energy and solar energy.

This makes geothermal heating a reputable and available source of energy.<p>
