<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor office, classroom or laboratory environments, instead of outside or industrial settings. In jobs where union membership is not an issue, an HVAC technician might complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that disperses the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This includes cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, connecting the ducts to the HVAC unit, and mounting the ductwork in the building. It may also consist of the installation of registers where the ductwork links to private areas.<p>
<p>Geothermal HVAC systems are ending up being common features of eco-friendly houses as part of the growing green building movement. Green jobs accounted for 20 percent of all freshly developed houses in the U.S. last year. By 2016, a Wall Street Journal article forecasted that green housing will grow from $36 billion a year to as much as $114 billion. That's approaching 30 to 40 percent of the entire real estate market.<p>
