<p>Called WSE for a regular assessment. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & knowledgeable throughout the check out. They suggested changing a few parts that were going out. They weren't cheap but a fast internet search validated WSE wasn't pumping up costs, so I gladly had them changed. However, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in very same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was faulty. No charge for the go to or the brand-new part. I was very pleased they stood by their work and fixed the problem. Will definitely be utilizing them once again.<p>
