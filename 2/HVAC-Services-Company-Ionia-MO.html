For example, wetness management and humidity control requires systems to be set to provide makeup air at lower temperature levels (design levels), instead of the greater temperature levels sometimes utilized to conserve energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions.

<p>All heater have some level of air purification. From one of the most standard, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the bigger, 4-inch media filter frequently in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more advanced electronic air cleaners and air cleansers, all require some standard maintenance. These filters aid with indoor air quality by trapping air-borne contaminants streaming through your system. They can also keep your system performing well by helping in reducing the accumulation of dust, dirt and other particles from accumulating on internal elements like the blower motor, burners and heat exchanger.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems utilize capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power offered to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to switch on. In time, capacitors can break, and when they do, you'll observe the motor running hotter. Before that occurs, you wish to get those capacitors changed to avoid further damage to your system.<p>
