<p>I have actually been using them for years for my organisations, my own homes and my real estate clients' houses. I went through 5 other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies estimated me with various rates and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who discussed to me completely the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC stopped working at my rental home. He helped me difficulty shoot the problem when I called and he advised me to call guarantee which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the unit working again. He is sincere, dependable, and affordable on rate. It's tough to find a truthful AC person and I'm thankful I discovered Luis. Extremely recommend Luis and his company.<p>
