<p>A clogged furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut down. Dirty filters are the most common cause of furnace issues.

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may believe. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a little, low-cost flexible hose pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and use and is easily punctured.<p>
