<p>Sun Ray Solar water heater need reasonably little attention. But, just like any mechanical system, some fundamental maintenance is important to keep the system functioning efficiently. The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heater are similar to those of conventional hot water heater. The collectors, piping and tank need to be checked for leakages, the system should be flushed periodically to remove tank and collected pollutants (scaling in tough water locations). The systems should be checked a minimum of twice annually for an appropriate operation of the pump, controller and sensors. The collector's glass can be washed occasionally to get rid of dust gathered in order to enhance collector effectiveness.<p>

No extra charge.<p>
