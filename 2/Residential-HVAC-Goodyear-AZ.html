<p>Weatherization generally does not cause indoor air problems by including brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes emit contaminants.) Nevertheless, measures such as setting up storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the quantity of outdoor air infiltrating into a house. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Biological contaminants consist of germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these pollutants. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are transferred by animals and individuals; bacteria are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and household animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent irritant. It can end up being airborne when it dries. Infected central air conditioning handling systems can become reproducing premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then disperse these contaminants through the house.<p>
