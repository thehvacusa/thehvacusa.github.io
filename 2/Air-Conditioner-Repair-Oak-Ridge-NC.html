<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, inspect these 3 things initially. Ensure all the signs up in your home are broad open. Then make certain the furnace filter is clean Then go tidy and outside off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If numerous signs up were closed or the filter was blocked, the decreased airflow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. If you've changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or till there's excellent air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually solved the issue.<p>
