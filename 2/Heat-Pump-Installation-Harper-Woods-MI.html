Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to make certain they were no concerns aside from the blower motor. Because there was not one on hand, the only factor he might not set up the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the issue is.<p>

I myself was also in the service call service many years back and understand the importance of having the right parts on the truck to get any task back up and running.
