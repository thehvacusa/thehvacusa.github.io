<p>Many central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air circulation system.

<h3>Air Conditioner Servicing in Robert LA</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government agency, conducted a study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy expenses by improving air flow. After evaluating 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no considerable enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy performance. In some cases, determined particle levels actually increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
