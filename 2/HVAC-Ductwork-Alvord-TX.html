<h3>Signs You May Need an AC Repair Service at Alvord TX</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government company, carried out a research study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy costs by improving air flow. After testing 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no substantial improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy effectiveness. In many cases, measured particle levels in fact increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common mix used in automobiles in the U.S. till 1994, when most designs altered to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer made in the U.S. for this type of application, but is still imported and can be acquired and utilized by certified HVAC service technicians. For systems requiring just a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in excellent working order and performing far better than virtually all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "inexpensive" by lots of people.<p>
