<h3>Factors to Consider When Looking for a Good AC Repair Company at Woodland GA</h3>
<p>Sean was really valuable. He is a really pleasant person to deal with. No pressure used to purchase extra stuff. Responded to all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to ensure they were no issues other than the blower motor. Since there was not one on hand, the only factor he might not set up the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the problem is.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical mix utilized in automobiles in the U.S. until 1994, when most designs changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting capacity of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer manufactured in the U.S. for this kind of application, but is still imported and can be bought and used by licensed HVAC specialists. For systems requiring just an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in excellent working order and carrying out far better than essentially all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "cheap" by many people.<p>
