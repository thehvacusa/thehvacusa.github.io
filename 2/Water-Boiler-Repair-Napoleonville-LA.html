<p>The quality of the air inside our schools, houses and work environments matters, particularly considering that we spend the majority of our lives inside.

Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and since the air conditioning unit will need more energy to cool your house. A more suitable alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be included as a retrofit to many existing systems.<p>
<p>Place the solar storage tank near the conventional hot water heater. If the heat exchanger is internal to the tank, make sure that the glycol loop connections to the heat exchanger and the cold and hot water connections are available. It is likely that it is supported by the pipes if the heat exchanger is external to the storage tank. Set up unions at the tank and heat exchanger connections so that the piping will not have to be cut if the tank or heat exchanger ever require to be replaced.<p>
