<p>People operating in structures with bad IAQ might discover unpleasant or musty odors or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about signs that occur at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more serious issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ issues. If you have symptoms that are not going away or are worsening, talk with your medical professional about them. However not all exposures cause signs, so there is no alternative to great building management.<p>

However more complicated problems-- recognized by regularly undesirable air quality monitoring results-- will require a various tack. Depending on the issue you're experiencing, among the 3 strategies below may be suitable.<p>
