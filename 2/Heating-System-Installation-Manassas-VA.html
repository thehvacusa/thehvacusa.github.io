<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government firm, conducted a research study in the 1990s to investigate 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it lowers energy costs by enhancing airflow. After evaluating 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no significant enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy performance. Sometimes, determined particle levels actually increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>There's a huge distinction in between the heat transfer of radiation and the other typical form of house heating-- convection. Over the past century, the majority of homes in cooler environments were heated up by convection, rather than radiation.
