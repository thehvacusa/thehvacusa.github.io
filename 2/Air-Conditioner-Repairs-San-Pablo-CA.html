<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you must watch out for. First, you should inspect your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>
