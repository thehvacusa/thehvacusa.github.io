This might appear a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>
