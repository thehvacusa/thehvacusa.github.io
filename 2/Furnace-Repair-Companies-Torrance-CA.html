<p>Because an air conditioner moves heat in between the outside coil and the indoor coil, both need to be kept clean. This means that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also needed to frequently clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will eventually result in damage to the compressor, because the condenser coil is accountable for releasing both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
