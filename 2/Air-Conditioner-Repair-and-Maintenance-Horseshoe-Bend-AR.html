<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable in time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a structure as fairly unchanged physical material gradually. In fact, the real nature of buildings can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research study using the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
