<p>I am very pleased with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the issue within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call company many years ago and know the importance of having the best parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also satisfied that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year.

<p>Central air conditioning conditioners, typically referred to as central air" or split-system air conditioning", distribute cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and registers (i.e., openings in the ceilings, walls, or floorings covered by grills) bring cooled air from the a/c unit to the house. This cooled air ends up being warmer as it distributes through the house; then it recedes to the central air conditioner through return ducts and registers. Find out how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
