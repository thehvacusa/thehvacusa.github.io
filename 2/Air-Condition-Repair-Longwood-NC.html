Therefore, measurements of co2 for functions of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged duration of consistent tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine co2 need to be adjusted regularly, and outside measurements used for computations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level effects on measurements made outdoors may also be necessary.<p>
