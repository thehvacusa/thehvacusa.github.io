Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in since the storage functions as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>

The energy performance of central air conditioning systems is measured by the variety of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions. As discussed above, a BTU is a conventional system of heat; it is specified as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit.

<p>The main reason property owners do not buy an HVAC service contract is the cost. They can cost between $150 and $500 each year, depending on the amount of services provided.

The heat exchanger allows air to be warmed without being available in contact with the actual flame or burner area. Once it reaches an adequate temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the home's duct, providing warm air to individual bedrooms, living rooms and kitchens through the vents or registers.<p>
