<p>Due to the present Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The ability to cool and heat your house at optimal efficiency will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is currently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot home will require a much bigger AC unit than a smaller sized house, which will affect installation costs. Also a house with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no cracks for air flow will need far less AC capacity to keep temperature levels comfy. Other elements that can impact this could be the insulation somewhere else such as the structure, roof, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
<p>When trying to figure out how frequently I must change my air conditioning filters, there are many things to take into factor to consider. Every Houston Heights 77007 77008 house has a special DNA on how it builds up dust and dirt. It takes about 6 months of close observation to see how frequently your a/c filter gathers dirt and dust. After that, you can make a better ideal decision on how typically your HVAC filters need changing. Some Houston Midtown 77003 77004 houses have more than one HVAC filter, like townhouses. The more air filters you have in your Houston Galleria 77055 77056 77057 house, the less frequently you'll have to clean them. Houston Montrose 77006 77098 houses with just one air conditioning filter need replacing more frequently.<p>
