<p>Called WSE for a routine inspection. The tech showed up right on time and was well-informed & friendly throughout the see. They advised replacing a few parts that were heading out. They weren't cheap however a fast internet search verified WSE wasn't inflating costs, so I happily had them changed. Nevertheless, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in very same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was faulty. No charge for the see or the brand-new part. I was very pleased they stood by their work and fixed the problem. Will definitely be utilizing them again.<p>
