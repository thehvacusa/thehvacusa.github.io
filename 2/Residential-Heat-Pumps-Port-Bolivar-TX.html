<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, inspect these three things initially. Ensure all the registers in your home are wide open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go clean and outside off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The lowered airflow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if a number of registers were closed or the filter was blocked. If you have actually changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or up until there's good airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. You've solved the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
