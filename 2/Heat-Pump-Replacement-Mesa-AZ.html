<h3>How to Select An Expert HVAC Tech in Mesa AZ</h3>
<p>In the last several years, a growing body of clinical proof has suggested that the air within houses and other buildings can be more seriously polluted than the outdoor air in even the largest and most industrialized cities. Other research study indicates that individuals invest around 90 percent of their time inside. Therefore, for lots of people, the threats to health may be higher due to direct exposure to air pollution inside than outdoors.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
