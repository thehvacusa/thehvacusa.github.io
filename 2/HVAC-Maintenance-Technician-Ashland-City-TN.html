I am happy to say that not just did we get the central air going but also replaced the heating unit which was old. Everyone we spoke to from beginning to end were really professional, polite and the work was very efficiently done. I would extremely advise this company.<p>
<p>Additionally, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why rooms heated by radiators are susceptible to cold areas", suggesting that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and extremely hot next to the radiators. This usually results in opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go once again, letting all that energy paid to heat up the house escape out of the window. Convected heat provides warmth from the flooring up throughout the room without any cold areas or stuffiness in the area being heated up.<p>
