<p>In 2011, NASA watched for a cooling system to set up in their lunar electric rover. They decided they needed expert assistance and spoke with many providers. Lastly, after an extensive choice procedure, the area company picked Dometic. We have actually had a lot of firsts over the years, but this custom-made task provided special difficulties for our engineers," stated a representative for Dometic.
