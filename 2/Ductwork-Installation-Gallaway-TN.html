A multi-split system 56 is a standard split system, which is divided into 2 parts (evaporator and condenser) and permits cooling or heating of a number of rooms with one external system.

<p>Radiant heat offers a number of unique advantages over forced air heating unit. For example, radiant heat systems are more energy effective than forced air systems. They don't have to worry about duct leaks, which are accountable for output losses of as much as 30% in other heating unit types. Transferring heat through solid items will likewise trigger it to last longer than using air as a thermal medium. A house warmed by a glowing system will warm up much faster, and remain warm with less energy invested. These are just a few of the lots of benefits that a radiant heating system can offer you.<p>
