<h3>Heat Pump Replacement in Cooleemee NC</h3>
<p>Some cooling systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heatpump, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise typically referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioning unit". The heatpump is considerably more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system likewise changes functions to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
