<p>HVAC Systems Can Add To Air Quality Problems. HVAC systems can also intensify indoor air quality problems. The HVAC system may be infected (because of mold in duct lining or germs on coil or filters, for example), and the system may spread these pollutants throughout the home.

<p>A primary factor in the avoidance of health symptoms is an efficient, correctly created and running ventilation system.
