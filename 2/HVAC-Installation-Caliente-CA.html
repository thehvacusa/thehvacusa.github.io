<p>In houses, the most substantial sources of formaldehyde are most likely to be pressed wood items made using adhesives that contain urea-formaldehyde (UF) resins. Pressed wood items made for indoor use consist of: particleboard (utilized as subflooring and shelving and in kitchen cabinetry and furniture); hardwood plywood paneling (utilized for decorative wall covering and used in cabinets and furnishings); and medium density fiberboard (used for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furnishings tops). Medium density fiber board contains a higher resin-to-wood ratio than any other UF pressed wood item and is typically acknowledged as being the highest formaldehyde-emitting pressed wood product.<p>
<p>This is especially notable, as gas stoves can trigger levels of pollution that would be illegal outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with badly adjusted gas ranges can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>
