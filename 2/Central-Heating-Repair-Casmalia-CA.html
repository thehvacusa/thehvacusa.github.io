Trace was on time, considerate, and appreciated my house by always wearing boot coverings when entering my home. He demonstrated the points of inspection and also suggested I have a UV light set up due to a little accumulation of mold building up in the air handler, which he thoroughly checked and cleaned up the outside compressor coils as well as ensured the wetness discharge tube was clear by using a cleaning liquid and a store vacuum. He also eliminated the leaves that accumulated inside the interior of the compressor unit and recommended an option to avoid it from continuing, which will do.I got a comprehensive email report of the assessment describing all the electronic measurements and service.Trace is a possession to Waychoff's and I highly advise him and Waychoff's for service and installation.<p>

<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to vaporize, thus the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it soaks up heat from the inside air, go back to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. While doing so, heat is taken in from inside and transferred outdoors, resulting in cooling of the building.<p>
