<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals. Recent studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned items are saved and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can save cash by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical during the pushing and finishing procedures. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to decrease your exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them up until they have been effectively dried if dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up. If items with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent check outs, attempt a various dry cleaner.<p>
