<p>Recent Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was educated and polite. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
