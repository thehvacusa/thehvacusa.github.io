<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Well-kept heating devices can last for many years. But if you're experiencing frequent breakdowns or your fuel costs suddenly appear higher than typical, it is most likely time to consider a new system.

An effective system implies less repairs, so you will not have to be as diligent when it comes to trying to find signs of problem and the month-to-month expenses will be less.
