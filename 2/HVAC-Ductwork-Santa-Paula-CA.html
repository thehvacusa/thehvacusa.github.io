This step is essential so the unit isn't too little or too large-both waste energy.<p>

<p>Ron, the owner, reached out to me relating to an abnormally high bill that I got blindsided by BEFORE he knew that I had called the service supervisor and left a message of issue.

<p>Indoor temperature levels are in some cases more tough to manage than they seem due to elements such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperature levels ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity should be kept at or below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to lower mold growth.<p>
<p>The predominant health effect connected with exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may position threats, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. Your danger of lung cancer is especially high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>
