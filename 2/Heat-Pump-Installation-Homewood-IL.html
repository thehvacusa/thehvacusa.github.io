<p>The bureau tasks 34 percent work growth for HVAC technicians between 2010 and 2020, more than twice the average for all professions.

<p>Allergens are products that cause an immune-type response in people who are sensitized to these products.

Irritants that are breathed in by sensitized individuals with asthma can trigger asthma attacks.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps end up being ineffective in more severe cold.

To make up for this, the heatpump system need to briefly switch back into the routine air conditioning mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
