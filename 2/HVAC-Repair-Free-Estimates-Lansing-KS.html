<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>A routine furnace tune up can go a long way towards lessening a lot of the concerns caused by accumulation of dirt and debris, and the assessments enable your contractor to monitor longer-term concerns and take proactive actions to help prevent premature failure or bothersome breakdowns during the heating season.

<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical blend utilized in cars in the U.S. up until 1994, when most styles altered to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12.

For systems requiring only a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in good working order and carrying out far much better than virtually all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "cheap" by numerous individuals.<p>
