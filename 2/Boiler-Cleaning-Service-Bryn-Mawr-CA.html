<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the auto debit, although my company does not offer auto debit numerous companies do so they can have a known amount of cash coming in each month, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. , if we do decide to provide auto debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Contract..
