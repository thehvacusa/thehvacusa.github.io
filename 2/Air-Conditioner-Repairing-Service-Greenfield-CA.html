<p>One of the disadvantages of central heating is that it's potentially expensive to set up, specifically in an older house. Depending on the kind of system installed, it can be noisy and trigger issues if you're extremely allergic to dust. In addition, specific fuels and equipment might need unique licenses, and there is limited versatility in case of altered heating requirements. During use, there is a dead time while heat is being transferred from the heating unit to the living space.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended period of consistent occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine carbon dioxide ought to be calibrated often, and outside measurements utilized for calculations ought to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature results on measurements made outdoors might likewise be essential.<p>

<p>The primary health effect connected with exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might position risks, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your risk of lung cancer is especially high.<p>
