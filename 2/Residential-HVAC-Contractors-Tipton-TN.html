After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply insane and all over the location and I think they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
