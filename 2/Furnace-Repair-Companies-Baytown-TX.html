<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely utilized in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Recent studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned products are stored and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical during the pushing and ending up processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to reduce your exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical smell when you pick them up, do not accept them until they have been correctly dried. Try a different dry cleaner if goods with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent sees.<p>
