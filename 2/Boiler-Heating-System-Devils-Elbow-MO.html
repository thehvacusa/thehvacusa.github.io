<p>Radiant heat covers a series of various heater, consisting of electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heating systems operate on similar concepts. When it comes to a boiler, the system heats by dispersing hot water through a series of pipelines set up in the sub-floor of each room.

As the hot water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the flooring and into the space.<p>

The second is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cables set under the floor are required to withstand existing, which then generates heat.<p>
<p>This is especially notable, as gas stoves can trigger levels of pollution that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with poorly adjusted gas ranges can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>
<p>The piping-- which is woven throughout the floor as a circulation system. Metal pipes are hardly ever utilized due to long-lasting destructive issues. Virtually all hydronic glowing floor heat systems today use 1/2 inch diameter plastic tubing made from PEX or Cross-linked Polyethylene piping. PEX is highly versatile, will not rust and is available in long lengths, which allow PEX pipe to be woven with very little or no joints.<p>
