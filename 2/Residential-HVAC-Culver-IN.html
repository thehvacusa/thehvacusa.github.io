<p>Improve your services, make more services income, and supply an incredible client experience. To make sure the system you choose is the right size for your house, the Sears HVAC expert does an electronic load computation quote to identify the specific kind of heat and cooling system that's ideal for your home-we don't simply replace it with the very same size unit you currently have. These estimations consider things such as the size of your house, its direct exposure to the sun and wind, the number and size of windows, how well insulated it is and more. This step is important so the system isn't too small or too large-both waste energy.<p>
<p>A SEER rating means Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio. The SEER score of an unit is the cooling output at differing temperatures during the cooling season divided by the overall electric energy input throughout the same duration. Essentially, SEER offers more data based on how the EER performs in various temps. The greater the system's SEER ranking, the more energy efficient it is. 1 An unit's SEER ranking can be discovered on the yellow Energy Guide tag affixed to all devices.<p>
