More serious than many allergenic properties is the capability of mold to set off episodes face to faces that already have asthma, a severe respiratory illness.<p>

<p>. Prior to selecting the installation location of air conditioning unit, a number of primary elements require to be considered. First of all, the direction of air circulation from the indoor systems should not fall on the location of rest or work area.

The outdoor system must also be found in an open area, otherwise the heat from the house will not be successfully discharged outside and the efficiency of the entire system will drop dramatically.
