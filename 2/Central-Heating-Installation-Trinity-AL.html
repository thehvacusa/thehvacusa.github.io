<p>Radiant heating systems don't use ducts, which makes them quite a bit more energy efficient than other systems. They also do not create hot and cold areas. All of the heat that radiant heat systems disperse relocations through solid things, keeping the heat near the flooring of the space where it is the most use. Radiant heating systems can also heat spaces with less energy spent, and keep them warmed for longer, since the majority of floorings tend to maintain heat much better than air does.<p>

<p>Current Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and experienced. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>

<p>My eldest son always grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a new one. For some time I dismissed him but then I realized that it really didnâ $ t distribute air like it did before. Weâ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnâ $ t truly consider anything else other than changing it. The one I got deserves every penny. The noise level is itâ and low $ s excellent on energy conserving too.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil absorbs heat from the air, cooling it, prior to the air is distributed back into your home. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is generally routed into a basement flooring drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
