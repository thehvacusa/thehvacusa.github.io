<p>A ducted heat pump appears like a big central air conditioner unit that sits outside your home. Heat pumps run on electrical power and work like air conditioning unit in reverse, utilizing a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outside air.

<p>When our furnace was dying, we called 2 local companies for bids. While both were handy and helpful, Ballard Natural Gas gave us a much better deal, for remarkable service. Rather than a basic sales task, the owner of the company made a complete assessment of our heating system and located ways we could have more even heat. He consisted of these significant but small modifications in his bid. We decided to change from a gas furnace to an electric heat pump because of recent warmer summer seasons and for environmental reasons.<p>
