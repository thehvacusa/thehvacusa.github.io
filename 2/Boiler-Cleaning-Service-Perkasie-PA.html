<p>HVAC is a fundamental part of residential structures such as single family homes, apartment buildings, hotels and senior living centers, medium to large industrial and office complex such as medical facilities and high-rise buildings, cars such as vehicles, trains, submarines, planes and ships, and in marine environments, where safe and healthy building conditions are controlled with respect to temperature level and humidity, using fresh air from outdoors.<p>
<p>Unpredictable organic compounds (VOCs)-- These are the primary factors to bad indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both inside and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals produced as gases from processes or items; for the most part, you can smell their presence. Normal sources of VOCs inside consist of things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as relatively innocuous as a new carpet is most likely to be emitting formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors could include volatile chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled within throughout water usage.<p>
<p>The primary health impact related to direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might posture dangers, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your risk of lung cancer is specifically high.<p>
