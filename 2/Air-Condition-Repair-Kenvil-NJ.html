<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a fairly easy to measure surrogate for indoor pollutants given off by people, and correlates with human metabolic activity. Carbon dioxide at levels that are unusually high inside might cause occupants to grow drowsy, to get headaches, or to function at lower activity levels. Outdoor CO2 levels are generally 350-450 ppm whereas the optimum indoor CO2 level thought about appropriate is 1000 ppm. 28 Humans are the primary indoor source of carbon dioxide in most buildings.

<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Simply take a photo of the wires prior to detaching anything (you might require a reference in the future). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp ports should snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you've switched all the wires, protect the brand-new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>
