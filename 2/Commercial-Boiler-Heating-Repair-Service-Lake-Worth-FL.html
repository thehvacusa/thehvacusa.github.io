<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may believe. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, economical flexible hose pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to tear and wear and is quickly punctured.<p>
