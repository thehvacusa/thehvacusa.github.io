<p>Certain instant impacts resemble those from colds or other viral diseases, so it is often difficult to determine if the symptoms are an outcome of direct exposure to indoor air contamination. For this factor, it is essential to take note of the time and location symptoms take place. If the signs fade or disappear when a person is far from the location, for example, an effort must be made to identify indoor air sources that might be possible causes. Some results may be worsened by an inadequate supply of outside air coming inside or from the heating, cooling or humidity conditions common inside.<p>

Without air flow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, because something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
