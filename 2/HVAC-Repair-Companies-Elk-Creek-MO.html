<h3>Advantages of Allergic Your Central Heating Boiler in Elk Creek MO</h3>
<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were really pleased that somebody as skilled as Adam was able to return and fix the air conditioner. We had actually bought the club member maintenance plan, which helped offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our idea to any property buyers: work with Blue Flame to check the a/c unit before you buy. We purchased this house in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, however Adam stated he had ways to test AC units even in winter season. We wish we had actually understood him then.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and knowledgeable. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
