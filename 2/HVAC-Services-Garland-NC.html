<p>All homes require reliable ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on however the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot light has been burnt out from usage.

If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it turns on or is humming, there might be an internal problem. While humming is caused by a slipped belt in the internal operations, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or perhaps a filthy burner.<p>
