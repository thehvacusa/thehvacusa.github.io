<p>A clogged up furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut off. Filthy filters are the most common cause of furnace problems. Dust and dirt limit air flow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will shut and overheat off too quickly, and your home will not heat up. Change the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. A dirty filter also causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, lowering the performance of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
