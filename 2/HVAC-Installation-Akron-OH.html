All of the latest furnaces are far more energy-efficient than those set up even twenty years back.

<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems utilize capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power offered to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to switch on. In time, capacitors can wear out, and when they do, you'll notice the motor running hotter. Before that happens, you want to get those capacitors changed to avoid more damage to your system.<p>
