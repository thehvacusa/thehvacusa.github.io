<p>An indoor air toxin is a compound in the air that may impact the health of people who reside in the home. Toxins might originate from outside the house-- such as an idling automobile engine in an attached garage, backyard trash burning, or radon entering your house from the ground below. An air toxin might likewise originate from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide from a defective furnace, unpredictable organic substances (VOCs) from a freshly painted space, pre-owned smoke, mold growing on moist or wet carpets, or chemicals from hobbies, family cleaning, or individual care products.

<p>Volatile natural compounds (VOCs)-- These are the primary contributors to bad indoor air quality; they are common both inside your home and outdoors.
