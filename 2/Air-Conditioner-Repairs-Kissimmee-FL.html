<p>When the heatpump headed out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was very valuable in collecting info on the phone and offering clear instructions about how to briefly cope with the problem and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly effective and used clear communication about the problem, its remedies, and its future prevention. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was professional and friendly. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi started.
