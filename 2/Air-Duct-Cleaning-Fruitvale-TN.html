<h3>Air Conditioner Repair and Maintenance in Fruitvale TN</h3>
<p>I usually do not leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You don't prepare for needing to change your AC system. Regrettably for us, we had no other alternative. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my options. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and talk about choices. I arranged my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a family friend and now I will recommend this company to my good friends.<p>
<p>EER stands for Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air units is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions. As mentioned above, a BTU is a traditional system of heat; it is defined as the quantity of heat needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The normal set conditions are outside temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why the majority of people do not use this measurement much anymore.<p>
<p>Current Review: They were excellent! Numerous HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to offer you with the service initially asked for. They met my requirements totally by offering a professional quote with choices, without pushing additional items. The team showed up on time, kept me notified as they worked, and completed a little early. The also without delay followed up with the essential inspections from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely recommend this company.<p>
