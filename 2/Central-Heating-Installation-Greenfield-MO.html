<h3>How to Choose An Expert HVAC Tech in Greenfield MO</h3>
<p>Many people know that outside air pollution can affect their health, however indoor air contamination can likewise have significant, harmful impact. EPA research studies of human direct exposure to air pollutants indicate that indoor levels of toxins might be 2 to five times-- and occasionally more than 100 times-- higher than outside levels. The EPA and its Science Board of advisers regularly rank indoor air contamination among the leading five ecological health dangers to the public.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
