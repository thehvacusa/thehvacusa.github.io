<p>Lead has actually long been recognized as a damaging toxic waste. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Person Services called lead the " top ecological risk to the health of kids in the United States." There are many methods which humans are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, infected soil, deteriorating paint, and dust. Airborne lead enters the body when a private breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has settled. Before it was understood how hazardous lead could be, it was used in paint, gasoline, water pipes, and numerous other items.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the eye, nose, and throat and triggers shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of respiratory infection; there is also evidence from animal studies that repeated exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung illness such as emphysema. People at particular risk from exposure to nitrogen dioxide include children and people with asthma and other respiratory illness.<p>
