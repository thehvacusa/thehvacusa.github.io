<p>1. Central Air Conditioning Source Heat Pumps Air source heat pumps work best in a moderate environment, where the temperature doesn't get too low or too high. Simply put, they are perfect for our Seattle climate! They are extremely effective, beating out most other kinds of heater in performance. The only real exception to this would be a geothermal heatpump system. However, a geothermal installation typically costs tens of thousands more than an air source heatpump, which normally implies it fails in terms of return on investment.<p>
