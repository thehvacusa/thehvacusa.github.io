<p>SysTech Design focuses on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for enhancing and maintaining the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The very same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it flows through your house. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stay with and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils ensures dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It likewise avoids water from building up on and underneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>
