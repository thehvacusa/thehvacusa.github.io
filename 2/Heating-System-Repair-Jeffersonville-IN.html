The average cost to set up a 14 SEER American Standard AC unit would be around $2,600 to $3,200.

<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external system to the internal ones, the primary problem. While setting up a different split system, employees try to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system creates more problems, since a few of indoor systems can be located far from the exterior. The very first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not permit you to set the a/c separately for each space. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a large selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical attributes of indoor units run individually from each other.<p>
