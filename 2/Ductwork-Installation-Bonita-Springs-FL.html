A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine could damage the engine elements. To prevent this from taking place, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator needs handled by professionals, check out Acme Vehicle Electric & Repair today.<p>
