<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Responsibility 50 gallon hot water heater. It went excellent. Dealing with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. Two on demand tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The team took the whole day as they required to eliminate the old water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the new high effectiveness heater. We decided on getting something more pricey than a conventional water heater as gas is among our most significant utility costs. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a very long time and use extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
