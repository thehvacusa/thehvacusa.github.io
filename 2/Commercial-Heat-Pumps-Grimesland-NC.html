<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
