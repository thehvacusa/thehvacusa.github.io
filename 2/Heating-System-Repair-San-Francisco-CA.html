<h3>Local HVAC Companies in San Francisco CA</h3>
<p>At present, EPA does not advise utilizing air cleaners to minimize levels of radon and its decay products. The efficiency of these devices doubts since they only partially eliminate the radon decay products and do not reduce the amount of radon entering the house. EPA prepares to do extra research study on whether air cleaners are, or could become, a trustworthy means of minimizing the health danger from radon. EPA's brochure, Residential Air-Cleaning Gadgets, offers additional info on air-cleaning gadgets to minimize indoor air toxins.<p>
