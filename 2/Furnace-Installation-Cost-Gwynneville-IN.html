<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may believe. Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a little, low-cost versatile tube) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to tear and use and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>Oil heaters are usually not extremely efficient. They use less fuel than other furnace types, however most do not attain an efficiency higher than 90%. A few high-end brand names have an efficiency of 95% by using a condenser. These are more pricey, having beginning costs for the furnace itself at around $5,000. You pay more for the installation also because a drain needs to be set up.<p>
<p>With the cost of electrical power and gas increasing, it is very important to have your furnace tuned-up for maximum energy cost savings. This will keep you from unnecessarily paying more than you should.

<p>Keep an eye out for signs of water leaks or flooding to stop mold from growing. Porous products, ceiling, wall, and flooring coverings, and furniture found in the basements that have been wet for over 24 to two days may become a source for mold growth and must be discarded. Often there is a musty odor however mold can not be seen. Mold does not need light to grow and can grow in concealed or seldom accessed areas of your home, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a variety of surface areas: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on floor covering products consisting of carpet underpadding. Chances are there will be mold growing nearby if a source of water or condensation can be discovered. Fix the moisture issue, either by finding the leakage or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Thoroughly clean the location using established health department suggestions.<p>
