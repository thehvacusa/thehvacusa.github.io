<p>A packaged unit, usually installed on the roofing, is most frequently utilized on commercial structures, but it is also a choice for house owners to consider. Oftentimes, these systems contain not just the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this unit is certainly the cost. Packaged systems are fantastic for those aiming to save cash on the installation of a brand-new heating and cooling system separately, considering that the system is integrated.
