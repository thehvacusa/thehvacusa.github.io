<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is since ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil.
