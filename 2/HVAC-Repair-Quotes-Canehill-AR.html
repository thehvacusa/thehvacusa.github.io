<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is often in the variety of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), due to the fact that heatpump become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is since ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system must briefly switch back into the routine air conditioning mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
