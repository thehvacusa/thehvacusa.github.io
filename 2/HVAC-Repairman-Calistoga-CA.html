<p>Measurement treatments are being developed and demonstrated to assess building ventilation and indoor pollutant concentrations. These treatments range from sophisticated tracer gas techniques utilized primarily in developing research study efforts to less involved treatments that can be used by developing operators. NIST researchers are continually developing brand-new test treatments, and then demonstrating them in the field to assess their expediency and reliability. The efforts in which these procedures are shown in the field has led to the development of an essential database of structure ventilation and indoor air quality performance.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended period of steady tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine carbon dioxide should be calibrated regularly, and outside measurements used for calculations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature results on measurements made outdoors might likewise be essential.<p>
<p>In addition to getting the big picture" of your indoor air quality, an indoor air quality screen can be established to supply threshold alerts. If, for example, the outdoors air has a CO2 level of 400 ppm, you might set up your tracking devices to notify you when indoor levels reach 950, and when the air has actually reached critical point at 1100 ppm. From there you can take the proper action to solve the situation right away.<p>
