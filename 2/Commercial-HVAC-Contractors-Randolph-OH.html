<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a need for ac system repair, which you should keep an eye out for. First, you should inspect your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, however ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately if totally iced over.<p>
