<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
