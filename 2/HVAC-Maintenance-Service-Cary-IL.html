<p>A clogged furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut down. Dirty filters are the most typical cause of furnace problems. Dust and dirt limit air flow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too quickly, and your house will not warm up. Change the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. A filthy filter likewise causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, lowering the effectiveness of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>

Heat output is determined in British Thermal Units, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace should be matched to the size of the house. A small home, for example, might not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace might heat the home too rapidly and shut down for too long, leading to irregular temperature level levels.<p>
