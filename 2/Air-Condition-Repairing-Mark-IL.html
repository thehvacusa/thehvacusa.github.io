<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. The choice of indoor systems has one constraint: their overall power needs to not exceed the capacity of the outside unit. In practice, nevertheless, it is really typical to see a multi-split system with a total capability of indoor systems greater than the outdoor capability by at least 20%. However, it is incorrect to anticipate much better performance when all indoor units are switched on at the exact same time, since the overall capacity of the whole system is restricted by the capacity of the outside system. Simply put, the outside system will distribute all its power to all running indoor units in such a way that some of the spaces may not have a really comfortable temperature level.

If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, replace the filter. A dirty filter likewise causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, decreasing the performance of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
