<p>Packaged terminal air conditioning unit (PTAC) systems are also called wall-split a/c systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are often utilized in hotels, have two separate systems (terminal packages), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing unit on the exterior, with an opening going through the wall and linking them. This reduces the interior system footprint and allows each room to be adjusted independently. PTAC systems might be adjusted to supply heating in cold weather, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, transforming the air conditioning unit into a heat pump While room cooling offers maximum flexibility, when utilized to cool lots of spaces at a time it is normally more expensive than central air.<p>
