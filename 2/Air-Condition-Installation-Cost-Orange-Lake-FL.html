<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units utilize capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power readily available to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to turn on. In time, capacitors can break, and when they do, you'll notice the motor running hotter. Before that takes place, you want to get those capacitors altered to prevent additional damage to your system.<p>
