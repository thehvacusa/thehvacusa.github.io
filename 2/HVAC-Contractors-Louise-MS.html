<p>Heating is the biggest energy cost in the typical house. In very dry environments, evaporative coolers, sometimes described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature level of the incoming air is reduced, however it is also more humid, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. Some of the sensible heat of the entering air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the outcomes can be rather considerable.<p>

This might seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly if entirely iced over.<p>
