<p>Numerous Canadian jurisdictions do not have specific legislation that handles indoor air quality issues. In the absence of such legislation, the "basic duty clause" uses.

<p>While these actions will assist to keep your AC system in leading shape, be aware that there are maintenance items that just a trained HVAC technician will have the ability to do.
