<p>The directions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfy completing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We recommend you do the exact same. As soon as the circuitry is complete, energize the system for a few minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable heats up. Do not put the system into complete operation until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to appropriately solidify and cure-- generally 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm bathroom floor.<p>

Even if bleeding the furnace does work, but you find you have to do it regularly, it's most likely time for a professional opinion.<p>
