<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often receives ask for assessment and assistance in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. Throughout the 1970s, many house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation procedure. However, many of these houses were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this product. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was installed several years back are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<h3>Identifying Shoddy HVAC Ductwork in Pendleton SC</h3>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a relatively easy to determine surrogate for indoor toxins given off by human beings, and correlates with human metabolic activity. Carbon dioxide at levels that are unusually high inside might trigger residents to grow sleepy, to get headaches, or to work at lower activity levels. Outdoor CO2 levels are usually 350-450 ppm whereas the optimum indoor CO2 level considered appropriate is 1000 ppm. 28 Human beings are the main indoor source of co2 in a lot of buildings. Indoor CO2 levels are an indicator of the adequacy of outdoor air ventilation relative to indoor occupant density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, inspect these three things initially. Make sure all the signs up in your house are wide open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and clean off the condenser coils (Image 2). If a number of registers were closed or the filter was obstructed, the reduced airflow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. If you've altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or up until there's good airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've resolved the issue.<p>
