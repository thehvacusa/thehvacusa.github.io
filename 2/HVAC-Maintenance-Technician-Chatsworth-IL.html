<h2>How To Hire Certified HVAC Companies in Chatsworth</h2>

<p>Your full-service HVAC Repair and Installation Company. Even with regular preventive maintenance, however, there will constantly be the odd issue that occasionally shows up. It is extremely crucial that you call G & S Heating Cooling & Electric as soon as possible when you do notice your furnace acting oddly. The faster you respond to issues with your furnace, the simpler they are to repair. Waiting to require repairs will just make the problem worse, and typically more expensive.<p>
<p>A clogged up furnace filter can cause a furnace to turn off. Dirty filters are the most common cause of furnace problems. Dust and dirt limit airflow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will get too hot and shut off too quickly, and your house won't heat up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, replace the filter. A dirty filter likewise triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, lowering the efficiency of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
