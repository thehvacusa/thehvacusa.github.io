<h3>Truth About Stephens City VA Homeowners Need To Know About Ductwork</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Responsibility 50 gallon water heater. It went fantastic. Dealing with Braxten was an enjoyment.

The crew took the entire day as they needed to remove the old hot water heater and set up all brand-new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high effectiveness heater. We chose getting something more costly than a conventional hot water heater as gas is among our greatest energy expenses. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a very long time and usage very little energy to heat water.<p>
