<p>Indoor Air Quality Guide: Finest Practices for Design, Building And Construction and Commissioning is created for designers, design engineers, contractors, commissioning representatives, and all other professionals worried about indoor air quality. Sources of formaldehyde in the home consist of structure products, cigarette smoking, household products, and the use of unvented, fuel-burning devices, like gas stoves or kerosene space heating units. Formaldehyde, by itself or in mix with other chemicals, serves a number of purposes in made products. For example, it is used to include permanent-press qualities to clothes and drapes, as a component of adhesives and glues, and as a preservative in some paints and finishing products.<p>
<p>For example, contaminants may gather within the air diffusers and grills, introducing toxins into the environment. Or if the outdoor air intake is located near a source of moisture or other outside toxin, it might serve as a pathway to bring the contaminants inside. Or the ventilation system may not be working as well as it must-- if particles is blocking the outdoor air consumption, for example, or the filters are contaminated or poorly preserved.<p>
