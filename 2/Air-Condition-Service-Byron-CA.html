<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, however furnace professionals often discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Search for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Inspect the breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be totally depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>Rising energy expenses are not the only reason for high bills. Heaters typically lose their efficiency as they age, especially if they have not been appropriately preserved.

And, all of the money you pay your energy utility companies each month might be utilized to help you pay for a new, a lot more energy-efficient and energy conserving furnace. Start to compare the cost of your current heating expenses with heating expenses from the previous years. If there is a considerable distinction, then it's time to replace your furnace.<p>
