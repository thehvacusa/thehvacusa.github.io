These systems can obtain a geothermal performance of about 300 to 600 percent throughout the, Coldest winter nights; whereas air-source heat pumps can only obtain an effectiveness of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter season. Much like other kinds of heat pumps, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal effectiveness rated according to their coefficient of efficiency (COP). POLICE OFFICER rates just how much heat a system removes or produces (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system utilizes to produce the heating or cooling result. Many ground source heatpump have COPs of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this suggests is that for every system of energy used by a geothermal heatpump, roughly 3 to 5 systems are provided back in the kind of heat.<p>

If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
