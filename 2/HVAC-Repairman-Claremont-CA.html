<p>Many people underestimate the level of the indoor air contamination issue. Air contamination is typically visualized as the black smoke emitted from factories. Little thought is given to tobacco smoke and the by-products of aerosol sprays, paints, cleaners, and pesticides utilized in the house. To compound the problem, it is estimated that the typical American spends 70 percent to 90 percent of his/her time inside, and over half that time is spent in the home.<p>
<p>Benzene is a known human carcinogen. The primary indoor sources of this chemical are ecological tobacco smoke, stored fuels and paint materials, and auto emissions in attached garages. Actions that will minimize benzene exposure include removing cigarette smoking within the house, attending to optimum ventilation throughout painting, and disposing of paint products and unique fuels that will not be utilized instantly.<p>
<p>EPA's Total Direct exposure Assessment Approach (GROUP) studies discovered levels of about a dozen typical organic contaminants to be 2 to 5 times higher inside houses than outside, despite whether the houses were located in highly commercial or rural areas. Additional TEAM studies indicate that while people are using products containing organic chemicals, they can expose themselves and others to really high pollutant levels, and elevated concentrations can continue the air long after the activity is completed.<p>

This stipulation, typical to all Canadian occupational health and safety legislation, states that an employer should supply a safe and healthy  work environment. Thus, making certain the air is of excellent quality is the employer's task.<p>
<p>Since pesticides can be found far from the site of their initial application, it is prudent to reduce using chemical pesticides outdoors along with inside your home. Depending upon the site and insect to be controlled, several of the following actions can be effective: usage of biological pesticides, such as Bacillus thuringiensis, for the control of gypsy moths; selection of disease-resistant plants; and frequent washing of indoor plants and pets. Termite damage can be lowered or prevented by making certain that wooden structure products do not enter into direct contact with the soil and by storing firewood far from the house. By appropriately fertilizing, watering, and aerating lawns, the need for chemical pesticide treatments of yards can be considerably decreased.<p>
