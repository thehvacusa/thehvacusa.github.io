Set up a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard hot water heater are open, water will stream from the solar storage tank to the standard hot water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the water pipe going into and the pipes leaving the standard hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar storage tank past the traditional water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer when water temperature levels are high, and the traditional water heater can be shut down totally.<p>

<p>People operating in structures with poor IAQ might observe undesirable or moldy smells or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about signs that happen at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more severe issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ problems. Talk to your doctor about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting even worse. But not all direct exposures cause signs, so there is no replacement for good structure management.<p>
