<h3>Heating Installation in Livingston Montana</h3>
<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00. (He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I got a refund and grumbled) When this person belittled me for my "not comprehending", I tossed him off the home.<p>
<p>People who are allergic to these toxins must utilize allergen-proof bed mattress encasements, wash bedding in hot (130 degrees farenheit) water, and prevent space home furnishings that accumulate dust, particularly if they can not be washed in hot water.
