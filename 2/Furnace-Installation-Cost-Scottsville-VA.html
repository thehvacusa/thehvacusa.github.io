<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly stable with time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a building as relatively unchanged physical material with time. In reality, the real nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and comprehended as intricate systems. Research study applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
