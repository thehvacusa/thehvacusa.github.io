<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often receives ask for assessment and assistance in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. Throughout the 1970s, many property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation measure. However, many of these homes were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this product. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was set up several years back are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>Another option to oil furnaces are gas heating systems While oil is traditionally used in areas where gas lines do not run, there are times when you might have an option between the 2 types. Gas heating systems cost about the exact same, around $6,000 for a high-efficiency system. The genuine advantage of using a gas furnace is the lower cost of heating your home. Heating with gas expenses around $540 a year, instead of the $1,400 a year that it costs to heat with oil.<p>
<p>I had a horrible experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for setting up a furnace cost $1,300. Furthermore, the company used 98% of the existing product bought with your home.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning aid determine the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications result from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning takes place when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove moisture. The goal is to offer enough modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be set up to accomplish this. A typical component essential in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
