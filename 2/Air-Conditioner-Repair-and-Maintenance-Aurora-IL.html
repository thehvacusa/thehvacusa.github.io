<p>The piping-- which is woven throughout the floor as a circulation system. Metal pipelines are rarely used due to long-term destructive issues. Essentially all hydronic radiant flooring heat systems today use 1/2 inch diameter plastic tubing made from PEX or Cross-linked Polyethylene piping. PEX is highly versatile, will not rust and can be found in long lengths, which allow PEX pipe to be woven with very little or no joints.<p>
<p>In the case of heated water or steam, piping is utilized to carry the heat to the rooms. The majority of modern warm water boiler heating systems have a circulator, which is a pump, to move warm water through the distribution system (rather than older gravity-fed systems ). The heat can be moved to the surrounding air utilizing radiators, hot water coils (hydro-air), or other heat exchangers. The radiators may be installed on walls or set up within the flooring to produce floor heat.<p>
