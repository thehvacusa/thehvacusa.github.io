<p>I have actually been operating in HVAC for over 20 years. Now I am starting my own HVAC company. I can tell you that it is a tough job that the workers sweat and bleed at, particularly residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with customers and keeps people working. When a sales guy comes to your house he is there to offer, that is the only method he is paid. You have an excellent Tech PM your system, he is paying expenses and must not "require" to sell you something you do not require. Your $1500 UV light is something you were sold on. For me, I offer you the options for your needs and you choose if you require it.<p>
