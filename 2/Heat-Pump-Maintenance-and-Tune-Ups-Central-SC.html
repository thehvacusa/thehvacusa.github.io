Load computing is described as the Handbook J calculation and need to be carried out by the HVAC contractor prior to providing an installation or system cost for cooling. Move to another contractor if your contractor states they know the size of air conditioning unit you need based on experience or on square footage alone. Just like measuring the size of an unit needed based upon BTUs, determining the proper size of unit for your home also depends upon the unit load-- just how much cold air it will lose by space.<p>
