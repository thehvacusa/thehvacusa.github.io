<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil change' type of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'could' trigger a problem in the future. So he said I could swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>7 To check it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect beside the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature listed below the space temperature level, and after that change it ON. To prevent straining an air conditioning unit's compressor, wait a minimum of five minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You must hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>

Among the most common places for emergency ac repair midtown Tx security changes is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is a good chance; you may have a water leak in the attic if your Nest is showing a blank screen. The water triggers your emergency safety switch, thus cutting power to your HVAC transformer.
