<h3>Heat Pumps and Indoor Air Quality at Eldena IL</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government agency, conducted a study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy expenses by improving airflow. After checking 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no significant enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy performance. Sometimes, determined particle levels in fact increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased instantly after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Many factors affect IAQ. These factors include poor ventilation (absence of outside air), issues controlling temperature, high or low humidity, recent renovation, and other activities in or near a structure that can affect the fresh air entering the building. Often, particular contaminants like dust from construction or renovation, mold, cleaning products, pesticides, or other air-borne chemicals (consisting of small amounts of chemicals released as a gas gradually) might trigger bad IAQ.<p>
