<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has been revealed to cause cancer in animals.

Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve cash by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pressing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to lessen your exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them till they have been appropriately dried if dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical smell when you choose them up. Attempt a various dry cleaner if goods with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent visits.<p>
