They reflects the heat upwards into the floor tile instead of allowing heat to heat up the concrete piece below.

Without insulation boards it could take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>

Seek Advice From the U.S. Department of Energy's Database of State Incentives for Renewable Energy (DSIRE) to see if there are rebates, loans or tax deductions available for the installation of a more efficient in-floor heater where you live.<p>
<p>After the system has actually been checked for leakages, thoroughly insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with basic foam pipe insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers should be insulated with fiberglass pipe insulation. Duct tape can be used on the joints of the water piping insulation, and use the joint tape that features fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunshine can be safeguarded by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation utilized outside need to be protected with PVC insulation covers.<p>
