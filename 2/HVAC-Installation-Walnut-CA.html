After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply insane and all over the place and I think they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
