Luis was the sixth person, who described to me thoroughly the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC quit working at my rental house. When I called and he advised me to call warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working once again, he assisted me difficulty shoot the issue. He is honest, trusted, and affordable on price. It's difficult to find an honest AC guy and I'm thankful I found Luis. Extremely recommend Luis and his company.<p>
