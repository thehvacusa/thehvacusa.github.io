<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>The predominant health effect associated with direct exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might present dangers, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes countless preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. Your threat of lung cancer is specifically high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
