This is generally utilized in a third-floor or 2nd location and takes advantage of the floor joist cavities while avoiding the cost, weight and additional density of an in-screed concrete put. To make an under-timber radiant floor heat hydronic system effective, the joist areas are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are set up under the pipes to direct heat up.<p>
