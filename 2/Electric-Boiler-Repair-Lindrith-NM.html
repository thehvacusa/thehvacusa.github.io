<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional job finding the outside system as near to the house as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was really educated of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
