<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
