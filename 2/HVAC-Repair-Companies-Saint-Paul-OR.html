<p>It is still possible that an indoor air contamination problem exists if no pollutant sources are found. Extreme re-circulation of air leads to "stale air" conditions.

Because its condenser coil launches heat outside, a standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the space.

Instead, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier stays in the room as heat, so the space is in fact heated, simply as by an electric heating system that draws the exact same quantity of power.<p>

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
