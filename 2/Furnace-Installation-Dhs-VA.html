<p>We take a look at hints before we offer suggestions to change instead of repair a heating system. Among the hints we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy costs are high compared to use, or if energy bills are higher every year, we know the unit is not running effectively. It may be in perfect condition, however if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to change it with a more efficient model, then you would be losing money by not changing the older system.<p>
<p>Irritants are products that trigger an immune-type reaction in individuals who are sensitized to these products.
