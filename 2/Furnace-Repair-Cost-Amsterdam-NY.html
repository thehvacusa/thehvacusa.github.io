<p>If you presume a mold issue-- either since of visible growth or a musty odor consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it does not eliminate the mold.

The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can maintain and examine. Leaking return ducts can also present wetness. Once again, if you suspect a mold problem, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>
