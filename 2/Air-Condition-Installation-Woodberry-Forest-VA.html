<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the auto debit, although my company does not provide auto debit numerous companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money coming in each month, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. , if we do decide to offer car debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Contract.. There need to not be any reason why your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>

The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'might' cause a problem in the future. So he said I could switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the very same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
