<p>A customized a/c that is used only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It likewise uses a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a basic a/c unit because both the condenser and the evaporator are positioned in the same air path. A basic ac system transfers heat energy out of the room since its condenser coil launches heat outside. However, given that all components of the dehumidifier remain in the very same space, no heat is eliminated. Rather, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the room is in fact warmed, just as by an electric heating system that draws the same amount of power.<p>
