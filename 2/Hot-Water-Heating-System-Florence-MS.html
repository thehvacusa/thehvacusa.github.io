<p>How climate modification affects air quality and exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature level (which is a standard mode of operation for modern-day air conditioning unit) requires that the rate of energy removal by the ac system boost. This boost has the result that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the ac system removes that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c should increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of efficiency) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is activated, and the air conditioner has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The a/c unit's power usage will increase by 50 W to make up for this, therefore making the 100 W heating element cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
