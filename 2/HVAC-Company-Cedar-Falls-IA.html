<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
