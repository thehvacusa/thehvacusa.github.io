<p>If you believe a mold issue-- either because of noticeable growth or a musty smell consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it doesn't eliminate the mold.

Leaking return ducts can likewise present moisture. Once again, if you suspect a mold issue, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>
