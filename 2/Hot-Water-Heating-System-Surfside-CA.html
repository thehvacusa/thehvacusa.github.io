<p>Since it's the most common heating system in Seattle homes, I'll start with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is delivered to the spaces of your home through ducts, and cool air is collected by means of cold air return vents. Gas heaters are rated for efficiency. Older units from the 1970s may be ranked 65%, suggesting 35% of the heating energy is squandered during the combustion process. Today's designs range from a minimum of 78% approximately 98.5%.
