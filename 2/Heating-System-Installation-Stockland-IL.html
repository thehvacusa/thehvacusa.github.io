<h3>Determining Heat Pump Efficiency in Stockland IL</h3>
<p>Luis was immediately responsive to email and texts with concerns. He committed to the job based only on e-mails, showed up and delivered with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs offer was among the few reasonable ones got. Others were almost twice the quantity Protex estimated for low end off brand name equipment. I got Carrier. ProTex appropriately encouraged me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more money (Honesty) The install group was respectful of my home and installed the equipment in the anticipated amount of time. post install examination results look great for braising and pipes quality. New system cools much better than the 13 year old 4 ton R22 unit it changed (likewise Carrier).<p>
<p>Examine these three things first if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Ensure all the signs up in your house are wide open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go clean and outside off the condenser coils (Image 2). The minimized airflow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if numerous registers were closed or the filter was blocked. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or until there's excellent airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've fixed the problem.<p>
