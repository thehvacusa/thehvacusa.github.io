<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones, the primary issue. While installing a different split system, employees attempt to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system creates more difficulties, since some of indoor systems can be located far from the outside. The first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not permit you to set the cooling individually for each room. However, now the market has a large selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical characteristics of indoor systems operate separately from each other.<p>

<p>AC units and thermostats have built-in delay functions when they're shut down and after that repowered. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you've registered for an energy-saving device from your local power utility, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you have actually installed the parts revealed and re-installed the detach block, repowered the breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and decreased the temperature below the indoor temperature level, and the system does not fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
