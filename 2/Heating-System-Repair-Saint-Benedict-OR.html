Mold begins with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and keep. Leaky return ducts can also introduce wetness. Once again, if you believe a mold issue, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leakages.<p>
