<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our expert cleaning and sanitizing services are classified as an Important Business in Los Angeles. Today's heaters are rated 90% performance or much better; it is not uncommon for a contemporary furnace to be ranked 94 or 95% efficient. Compared to older designs, which may be ranked as low as 80% performance, this can suggest substantial cost savings in yearly heating costs. Modern two- and three-stage heating systems increase efficiency even further by running at lower or higher capability depending on the heating requirements of the area.<p>
<p>A ducted heatpump appears like a large central air conditioning conditioner unit that sits outdoors your house. Heat pumps operate on electrical energy and work like ac system in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outdoor air. This allows them to produce two to three times as much heat as a basic electric heater (like an area heating unit) with the exact same amount of electricity. They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>
