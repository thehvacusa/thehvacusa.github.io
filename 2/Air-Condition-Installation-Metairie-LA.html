<h3>Benefits of Professional AC Repair in Metairie LA</h3>
<p>Under-timber piping is where hydronic piping is set within a wooden flooring joist system, beneath the wooded subsurface and final flooring surface. This is usually utilized in a 2nd or third-floor  area and makes the most of the flooring joist cavities while preventing the cost, weight and additional thickness of an in-screed concrete pour. To make an under-timber radiant floor heat hydronic system effective, the joist locations are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are set up under the pipes to direct heat upward.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
