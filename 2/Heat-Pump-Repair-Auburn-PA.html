They can be exposed to unfavorable weather for long periods of time. Because they are contacted us to structures without operating environment control, they are also subject to the extreme hot or cold temperature levels existing inside a place.<p>
<p>Air conditioning system producers usually make rugged, high quality items. If your air conditioning system stops working, begin by checking any fuses or circuit breakers. Let the system cool down for about five minutes before resetting any breakers. If a central air conditioning conditioner's compressor stops on a hot day, the high-pressure limitation switch may have tripped; reset it by pressing the button, located in the compressor's access panel.<p>
