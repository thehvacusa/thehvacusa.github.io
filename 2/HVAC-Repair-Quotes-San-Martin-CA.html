<h3>Air Conditioning Installation Cost in San Martin CA</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may think. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, economical versatile hose) instead of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to use and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
