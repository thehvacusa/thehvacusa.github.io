<p>It's a truth that a new furnace for your house is one of the more significant costs involved in home ownership. However, it ought to also be viewed as a long-lasting investment. All of the current furnaces are far more energy-efficient than those installed even 20 years ago.

<p>When setting up over concrete slabs, we suggest using our insulation boards.

They shows the heat upwards into the flooring tile rather of permitting heat to heat up the concrete slab below. By using Warmup Insulation Boards you will find that after switching on your heating, your floor tiles will warm up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it might take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
