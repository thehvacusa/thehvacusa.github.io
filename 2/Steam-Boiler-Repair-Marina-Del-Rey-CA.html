<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor office, classroom or laboratory environments, instead of commercial or outside settings.

<h3>Heat Pumps and Indoor Air Quality at Marina Del Rey CA</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Responsibility 50 gallon hot water heater. It went great. Dealing with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. 2 as needed tankless and one high performance tank. The crew took the whole day as they needed to get rid of the old water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high effectiveness heater. We decided on getting something more expensive than a traditional water heater as gas is one of our most significant energy expenditures. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a long time and usage extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
