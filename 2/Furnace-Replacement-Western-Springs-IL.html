<p>A blocked furnace filter can cause a furnace to turn off. Unclean filters are the most typical reason for furnace problems. Dust and dirt limit air flow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too quickly, and your home will not heat up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, replace the filter. A filthy filter also causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, lowering the efficiency of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
