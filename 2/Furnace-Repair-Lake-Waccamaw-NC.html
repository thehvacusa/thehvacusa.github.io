He dedicated to the task based just on emails, appeared and provided with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs deal was one of the few affordable ones received. Others were almost twice the amount Protex estimated for low end off brand name devices. I got Carrier.

New system cools better than the 13 years of age 4 load R22 unit it changed (likewise Provider).<p>

I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>

EPA's brochure, Residential Air-Cleaning Gadgets, offers more details on air-cleaning gadgets to minimize indoor air contaminants.<p>
