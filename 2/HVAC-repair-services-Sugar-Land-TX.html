<p>Air conditioning can likewise be provided by a process called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added because the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, therefore declining its efficiency.<p>
<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particle matter is a mixture of solid particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, pollen, and soot. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- because they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outside PM, generated by building and construction, for example, or the burning of fossil fuels, participates in buildings through mechanical and natural ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
