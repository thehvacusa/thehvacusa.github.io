This is usually used in a third-floor or 2nd area and benefits from the floor joist cavities while preventing the cost, weight and extra density of an in-screed concrete put. To make an under-timber glowing floor heat hydronic system efficient, the joist areas are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are installed under the pipes to direct heat upward.<p>
