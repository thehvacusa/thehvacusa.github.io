<p>Next, and possibly just as crucial when it comes to central air costs, is the AC unit's size. An unit that is too big will have an easy time keeping the home cool, but will have a more difficult time removing humidity from the air. On the other hand, a system that is too little will not be able to correctly cool the house on hot days. Thinking about larger units cost more than smaller sized systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC unit your central air conditioning system needs to hold.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the main reason for indoor air quality problems. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not bringing in sufficient outdoor air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air contaminants out of the location. Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
