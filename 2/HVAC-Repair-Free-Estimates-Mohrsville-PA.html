<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, inspect these three things initially. Ensure all the registers in the house are large open. Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go clean and outside off the condenser coils (Image 2). The minimized air flow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if a number of signs up were closed or the filter was blocked. If you have actually altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or till there's good airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You've fixed the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
