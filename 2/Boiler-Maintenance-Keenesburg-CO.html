<p>A car's coolant system transfers excess heat from one part of the engine and finally loses it through the radiator fins. With time, the coolant ends up being unclean and old. The old coolant will negatively affect the system's efficiency. To ensure the system is working successfully, think about having a regular coolant system flush. A coolant flush is basic maintenance for your cars and truck's cooling system. Call 206-523-2133 or visit Acme Auto Electric & Repair in Seattle, WA 98103 for all your coolant system flush and fill requirements.<p>
<p>The cost for heatpump installation also depends upon the size of the system and whether it is a single-room or whole-home system. A single-room air-to-air system can cost as low as $500, including installation. Whole-house systems, on the other hand, range in price from $2,500 to $7,500, consisting of installation. Geothermal heat pumps typically need excavation to install, which adds several thousand dollars to the cost.<p>
<p>Carbon monoxide (CO) is an odorless, colorless harmful gas. Since it is impossible to see, taste or smell, CO can eliminate you before you know it is in your house. At lower levels of exposure, CO triggers moderate effects that are typically mistaken for the influenza. These signs include headaches, dizziness, queasiness, fatigue and disorientation. The impacts of CO exposure can vary significantly from individual to individual depending on age, general health and the concentration and length of exposure.<p>
