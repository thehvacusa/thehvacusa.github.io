<p>Recent Review: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and knowledgeable. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
