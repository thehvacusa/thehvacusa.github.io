<p>A third method to decide whether your house might have poor indoor air quality is to look at your way of life and activities. Human activities can be considerable sources of indoor air pollution. Finally, look for signs of problems with the ventilation in your home. Signs that can suggest your house might not have adequate ventilation consist of moisture condensation on windows or walls, stinky or stuffy air, dirty central heating and air cooling equipment, and locations where books, shoes, or other items end up being moldy. To identify smells in your home, step outside for a couple of minutes, and then upon reentering your house, note whether odors are visible.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning aid determine the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes arise from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of wetness. The objective is to supply adequate modifications to make sure a healthy environment. There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be set up to achieve this. A typical component required in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) offers guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
