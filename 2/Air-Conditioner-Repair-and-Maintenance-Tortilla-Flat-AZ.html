<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might believe. Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a little, affordable flexible tube) instead of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to use and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
