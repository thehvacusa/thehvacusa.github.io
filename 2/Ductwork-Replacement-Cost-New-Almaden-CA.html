<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel regularly receives ask for assessment and support in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. Throughout the 1970s, many property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation step. However, a number of these houses were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this item.

<p>The EPA and CMHC researchers utilized various methods. The CMHC study contacted numerous duct-cleaning services. The companies were not made aware they belonged to a study, and the scientists did not control for time spent or techniques used. The EPA study recommended and managed methods used on a smaller variety of houses. While the duct-cleaning industry argues both studies have defects, no other research study has actually challenged the findings. And although the equipment and approaches used by duct-cleaning companies have changed because these research studies were carried out, the air ducts in homes haven't.<p>
<p>The majority of central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air circulation system. Thus, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to disperse cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside your home flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your house. When the a/c works but your house does not cool, the problem is most likely in the distribution system.<p>

<p>Inquire about training and certifications. A good place to start is the North American Technician Quality (NATE) accreditation. It's sort of a minimum requirement for choosing an HVAC company, but a lot of contractors out there have not troubled with it! Kick it up a notch by trying to find Structure Efficiency Institute (BPI) certification.

Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with a program. While Angie's list is a great base line indication that you MIGHT be working with a reliable company, you still should do your research (not all contractors with a similar ranking are the same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (A/c contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Also, there are natural causes for indoor air pollution. For example, humans breathe out co2, which in little amounts is not hazardous, however may become hazardous if high concentrations are permitted to accumulate. Germs or micro-organisms may likewise exist within the ventilation system. They might spread throughout the whole workplace or structure by methods of the ventilation system if micro-organisms do develop.<p>
