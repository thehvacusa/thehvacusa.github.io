According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air pollutants are typically 2 to 5 times higher than outdoor levels, and in many cases these levels can exceed 100 times that of outside levels of the same toxins. To put it simply, sometimes the air inside can be more hazardous than the air exterior.<p>
<p>For instance, impurities might gather within the air diffusers and grills, introducing pollutants into the environment. Or if the outdoor air consumption is located near a source of wetness or other outdoor contaminant, it may work as a path to carry the pollutants inside. Or the ventilation system might not be working along with it must-- if debris is blocking the outside air consumption, for example, or the filters are infected or improperly preserved.<p>
