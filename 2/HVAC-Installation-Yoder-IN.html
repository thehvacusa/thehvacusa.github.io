<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become ineffective in more severe cold.

To compensate for this, the heatpump system need to briefly switch back into the routine cooling mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
