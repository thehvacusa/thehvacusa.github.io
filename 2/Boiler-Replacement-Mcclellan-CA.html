<p>A geothermal heating system is more trusted than options, and is not affected by any external elements, unlike other renewable resources such as wind energy and solar energy. For example, wind energy can only be used when there is wind, while solar power depends on routine sunshine to work effectively. Geothermal heating depends on neither the sun nor the wind, but instead takes its heat from the earth's crust, which is constantly hot. This makes geothermal heating a trustworthy and offered source of energy.<p>
