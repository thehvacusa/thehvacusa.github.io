<p>A specific air conditioner that is utilized only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It likewise uses a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a standard air conditioner because both the condenser and the evaporator are positioned in the same air course. Since its condenser coil launches heat outside, a basic air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the space. However, because all parts of the dehumidifier are in the same room, no heat is gotten rid of. Rather, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier remains in the space as heat, so the room is in fact heated up, just as by an electric heater that draws the very same quantity of power.<p>
