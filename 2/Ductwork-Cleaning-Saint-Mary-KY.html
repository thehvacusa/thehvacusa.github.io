<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the car debit, although my company does not provide car debit lots of companies do so they can have a known amount of cash can be found in on a monthly basis, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year.
