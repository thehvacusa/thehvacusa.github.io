<h2>How To Hire Professional HVAC Company in Wendover</h2>

<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, but furnace service technicians often discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Look for a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Examine the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be completely depressed for the furnace to run.<p>

<p>Reinstall the gain access to panel and disconnect block. Switch on the circuit breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature level and await the AC to begin (see Be Client at Startup," listed below). The compressor must run and the condenser fan should spin. If the compressor starts however the fan does not, the fan motor is probably shot. Turn off the power and get rid of the screws around the condenser cover. Raise the cover and remove the fan blade and motor (Picture 7). Re-install the blade and protect the cover. Then repower the unit and see if the fan starts. If  it does not, you have actually offered it your finest shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>
