<p>Nick B. provided exceptional, individualized, mindful, and quality service. His communication style gets along, effective and engaging. He plainly and thoroughly discussed all issues and repairs in a manner that made me positive in his capability to solve my repair issues. He followed through and went the extra mile to personally pick up a needed part that was not in stock, making sure repairs were made so that my other half and I would not need to withstand another night without heat, during among the coldest winter seasons in current memory. He also reacted to my call right away the next early morning, and coached me through a temporary fix to a problem that couldn't be resolved on the first check out due to unavailable parts. I trust Nick's abilities, experience and capability to provide consistent, quality service.<p>
<p>It is common to assume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly stable with time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a building as fairly unchanged physical material gradually. In fact, the real nature of buildings can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research using the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
