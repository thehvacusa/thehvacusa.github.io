<h3>Identifying Shoddy HVAC Ductwork in Harvest AL</h3>
<p>Co2 (CO2) is a relatively simple to determine surrogate for indoor toxins released by humans, and associates with human metabolic activity. Carbon dioxide at levels that are unusually high inside your home may cause residents to grow sleepy, to get headaches, or to function at lower activity levels. Outside CO2 levels are typically 350-450 ppm whereas the maximum indoor CO2 level considered appropriate is 1000 ppm. 28 People are the primary indoor source of co2 in many structures. Indoor CO2 levels are an indication of the adequacy of outside air ventilation relative to indoor resident density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>Lots of factors impact IAQ. These factors include bad ventilation (lack of outdoors air), issues controlling temperature, high or low humidity, recent renovation, and other activities in or near a structure that can impact the fresh air entering the building. Sometimes, specific contaminants like dust from building or restoration, mold, cleaning supplies, pesticides, or other air-borne chemicals (consisting of small amounts of chemicals launched as a gas over time) may cause poor IAQ.<p>
