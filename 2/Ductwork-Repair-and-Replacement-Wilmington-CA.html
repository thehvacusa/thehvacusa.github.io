Taylor took adequate time to help us dispute which upgrades were cost reliable, which upgrades we might do ourselves and what would yield us the largest cost savings. We never felt hurried and Taylor's technical understanding of IES's product and services was remarkable. Taylor helped us narrow the scope to an affordable level, a heat pump replacement for our oil furnace, while permitting me to perform the needed electrical enhancements to save money on cost.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is unworthy the paper it is written on. Every technician will inform you clean up the filters, take a hose pipe two times a year and clear out the compressor cabinet.

Now the "difficult part" once a year turned off the electricity open the furnace and very carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the parts, close up the cabinet returned on the electrical power. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
