<p>Unstable natural substances (VOCs)-- These are the primary contributors to poor indoor air quality; they are common both indoors and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals emitted as gases from items or procedures; for the many part, you can smell their existence. Typical sources of VOCs inside include things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as relatively innocuous as a brand-new carpet is most likely to be emitting formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside could consist of unstable chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled inside during water usage.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the main cause of indoor air quality issues. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not generating sufficient outdoor air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air contaminants out of the location. High temperature and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
