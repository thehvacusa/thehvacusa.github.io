<p>To say there are a lot of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the air conditioning system back into its original box, using the dense-foam packaging product to protect it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set package in a cool, dry location for the winter season. And if the storage room has a concrete floor, location two 2x4s beneath the box to raise it up and protect it from moisture.<p>

If you purchase a new gas stove or range, consider buying one with pilotless ignition since it does not have a pilot burner that burns continually. Never use a gas range to heat your home. Constantly make sure the flue in your gas fireplace is open when the fireplace is in use.<p>
