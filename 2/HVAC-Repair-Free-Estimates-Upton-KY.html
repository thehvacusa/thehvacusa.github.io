They came out quickly and offered me a no nonsense price quote for the work. Even when it was news my client most likely wouldn't wish to hear, they didn't sugar coat anything. I appreciate the honesty. Integrity isn't just their name, it's a company design they take seriously. You people are formally on speed dial. Speak to you quickly.<p>
