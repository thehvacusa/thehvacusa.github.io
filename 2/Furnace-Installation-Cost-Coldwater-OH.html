<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the car debit, although my company does not use automobile debit many companies do so they can have a known quantity of cash being available in every month, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do choose to offer car debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There should not be any reason why your company can not use this. Hope this assists.<p>
