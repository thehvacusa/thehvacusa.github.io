<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Heating is the biggest energy expense in the typical home. In really dry environments, evaporative coolers, often referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature of the incoming air is decreased, but it is likewise more damp, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is the same. Some of the sensible heat of the getting in air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the results can be quite significant.<p>
