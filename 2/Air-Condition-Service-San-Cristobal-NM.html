<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently receives requests for consultation and assistance in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, many property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation step. Nevertheless, a number of these homes were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation.

<p>A/c can likewise be supplied by a procedure called free cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is included since the temperature of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, thus declining its effectiveness.<p>
