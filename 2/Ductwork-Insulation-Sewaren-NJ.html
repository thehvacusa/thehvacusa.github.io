<p>This is particularly significant, as gas stoves can cause levels of contamination that would be unlawful outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with inadequately adjusted gas ranges can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>

<p>Strained Systems Overheat - When your system is filthy, and filters are plugged, and possibly refrigerant is low, it will not be working at optimum efficiency and might overheat. This makes they HVAC system work harder, creating a cycle that does not end. An overworked system will also trigger your energy costs to rise. It's possible that the size of AC unit you have is not big enough for your house. It will have to work harder and may overheat if the system is too little. Typically, an HVAC system costs $4,820 to $9,350 to install a 5-ton system for a 2,000- to 3,000-square-foot house.<p>
