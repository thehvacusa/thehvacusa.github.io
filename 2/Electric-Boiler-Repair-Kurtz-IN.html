The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'might' cause a problem in the future. So he stated I could swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>

Start out part time with a set amount of hours you wish to work in your company. For example, you might want to work four hours each weekend and after that broaden it to include a 4 more hours for three or 4 days during the week. Understand the number of customers you can service within a week based on the hours you wish to devote to the business and your monetary objectives.<p>
