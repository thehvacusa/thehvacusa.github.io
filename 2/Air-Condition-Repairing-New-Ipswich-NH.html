<p>The quality of the air inside our schools, offices and homes matters, particularly because we spend the majority of our lives inside. Ac system help to dehumidify the inbound air, but in incredibly damp climates or in cases where the air conditioner is oversized, it may not accomplish a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and due to the fact that the a/c unit will need more energy to cool your house. A more effective option is a dehumidifying heat pipeline, which can be included as a retrofit to many existing systems.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan.

Unscrew the old AC contactor prior to eliminating the wires. Then move the wires to the new unit (Image 6).<p>
