<p>Excellent Item! Shipment was kind of odd being that package was opened and items could have fell out. However after review of contents we ensured it was all intact. The product was extremely lite weight and requires time to use. Note: buy recommended non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and needed to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Make sure to view the video initially prior to installation and follow all instructions precisely. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.

<p>I am very pleased with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the issue within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call service many years earlier and understand the importance of having the right parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also amazed that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would recommend them to everyone. Thank You quite.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) might not be the most pernicious aspect impacting indoor air quality, but it is frequently utilized as a surrogate for air quality and structure occupancy level. The more residents there remain in a room or building, the more CO2 is released into the air. To avoid CO2 levels from increasing too expensive-- which can have a negative effect on occupants-- outdoors air must be intentionally brought into the structure through a ventilation system.<p>
