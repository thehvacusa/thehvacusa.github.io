<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has actually been shown to cause cancer in animals. Current studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned products are saved and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical during the pushing and completing processes. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to lessen your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical odor when you choose them up, do decline them until they have actually been properly dried. If products with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent check outs, try a different dry cleaner.<p>
