It likewise avoids water from accumulating on and below the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>

The first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not permit you to set the cooling individually for each space. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a broad selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor units run independently from each other.<p>
