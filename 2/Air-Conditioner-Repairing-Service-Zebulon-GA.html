<p>My home has 5 units, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00.

Next, turn off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then pull the disconnect block (Image 1) and clean the condenser coils (Photo 2). If the a/c service still does not work properly after you've cleaned up the condenser coils, installed a brand-new filter and opened all the supply vents, continue with the following repairs.

<h3>Heating And Air Conditioning Contractors in Zebulon GA</h3>
<p>I generally do not leave reviews but wished to share my experience. You don't anticipate having to change your AC system. Sadly for us, we had no other choice. What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my choices. After organisation hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and talk about alternatives. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a family friend and now I will recommend this company to my good friends.<p>
<p>The majority of well and city water does not usually contain lead. Water typically picks up lead inside the house from home plumbing that is made with lead materials.

Send out for the EPA pamphlet, Lead and Your Drinking Water, to learn more about what you can do if you have actually lead in your drinking water. Call EPA's Safe Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) for additional information.<p>
