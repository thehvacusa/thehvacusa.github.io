<p>Measurement treatments are being established and shown to assess building ventilation and indoor contaminant concentrations.

<p>It prevails to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, fairly steady gradually. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a building as relatively unchanged physical product in time. In reality, the true nature of buildings can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and comprehended as complex systems. Research study applying the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
