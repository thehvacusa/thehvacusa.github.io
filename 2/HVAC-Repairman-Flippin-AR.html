<p>It is common to presume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly stable in time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as reasonably unchanged physical material over time. In reality, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and comprehended as intricate systems. Research study applying the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
