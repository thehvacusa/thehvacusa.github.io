<p>Fact: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange devices normally lasts years, given that it is protected inside your home. When it does need to be replaced, the expenditure is much less than putting in a whole brand-new geothermal system, because the loop or well is the most expensive to install.

In the past, some poorly sized systems did overcool the ground or overheat over time, to the point that the system no longer had sufficient of a temperature gradient to work.<p>
<p>Allergens are materials that cause an immune-type response in people who are sensitized to these materials. Irritants discovered in indoor air are primarily biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, germs, and mold.

Allergens that are breathed in by sensitized individuals with asthma can cause asthma attacks. For instance, if you think of a group of individuals with asthma, the presence of cat irritant might bring on an asthma attack in people with cat allergies, but not in those individuals who do not have cat allergic reactions.<p>
