<p>AC units and thermostats have integrated hold-up features when they're shut down and then repowered. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you've subscribed to an energy-saving device from your local power utility, the system can take even longer to reset. If you have actually set up the parts revealed and re-installed the detach block, repowered the circuit breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and decreased the temperature level listed below the indoor temperature, and the unit does not fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
