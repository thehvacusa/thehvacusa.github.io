<p>One of the downsides of central heating is that it's potentially pricey to install, specifically in an older home. Depending upon the type of unit installed, it can be loud and cause problems if you're highly adverse dust. In addition, particular fuels and equipment may require special permits, and there is restricted versatility in the event of altered heating requirements. Throughout use, there is a time delay while heat is being transferred from the heating system to the living space.<p>
<p>Moreover, radiators heat the air nearest them initially, which is why spaces heated by radiators are vulnerable to cold areas", meaning that the air feels cold in the middle of the space and extremely hot beside the radiators. This typically results in opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go once again, letting all that energy paid to warm up your home escape out of the window. Convected heat supplies heat from the flooring up throughout the space with no cold spots or stuffiness in the area being heated.<p>
