Check the furnace blower for obstructing and clean it if the air filter is excellent to go. Have a look at the furnace blower motor and oil it if this does not work. Call a knowledgeable technician if you still can not figure out why your furnace keeps running.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and polite. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
