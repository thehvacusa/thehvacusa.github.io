<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent task finding the outdoor system as near the house as possible per my request. The task took two days and my yard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was very educated of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

We were referred by a household friend and now I will recommend this company to my friends.<p>
