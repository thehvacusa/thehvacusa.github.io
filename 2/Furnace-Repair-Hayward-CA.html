Due to the fact that they do not require any new ductwork to be set up, ductless heat pumps are great for additions. Due to the fact that an unit is installed in each room or area you want to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature level of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensing units that automatically raise the temperature in the room when you are present.<p>

<h3>AC Replacement in Hayward CA</h3>
<p>I normally don't leave reviews but wished to share my experience. You don't anticipate needing to change your AC system. Sadly for us, we had no other alternative. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my alternatives. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and talk about choices. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a family friend and now I will advise this company to my friends.<p>
