<h3>The Fundamentals of Central Heating and Air Conditioning in Charlotte NC</h3>
<p>Throughout winter, the ground source heat is absorbed by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  option through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid flows around this loop, sending the soaked up heat to a refrigerant via the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas. From here it goes through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression process. From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heating system.<p>

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice kinds on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system must temporarily switch back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
