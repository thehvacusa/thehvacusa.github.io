<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
