Next, shut off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then yank the disconnect block (Picture 1) and tidy the condenser coils (Photo 2).

Much like other types of heatpump, ground source heatpump have their geothermal effectiveness rated according to their coefficient of performance (POLICE). POLICE OFFICER rates just how much heat a system produces or removes (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system uses to develop the heating or cooling result.
