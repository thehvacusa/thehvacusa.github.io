<p>If you suspect a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of noticeable growth or a musty odor regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it doesn't remove the mold.

<h3>Things to Consider When Buying a Heat Pump in Avoca AR</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was quick and really clear about his inspection, guaranteeing I comprehended what was looked out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So maybe a little high on rate for this service, but the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
