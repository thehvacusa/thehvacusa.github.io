Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts.

<p>Before you go out and buy an a/c unit, there are a couple of things to choose initially. Where are you going to be setting up the a/c unit? If your home is not equipped with ductwork, do you want to set up some or go ductless? How big should the ac system be? Too big and you'll face problems with short-cycling, which can damage the air conditioning unit and shorten its life. Too small and your air conditioning unit won't be able to cool your house correctly. These are simply a few of the factors that you need to consider when buying a new AC system. Each choice can and will considerably impact your system's performance, which is why you can't manage to ignore any of them.<p>
<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mix of solid particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, smoke, and soot. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- because they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outside PM, produced by building, for example, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, participates in structures by means of natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>The predominant health impact associated with exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may pose risks, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Significant health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. Your threat of lung cancer is especially high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>
