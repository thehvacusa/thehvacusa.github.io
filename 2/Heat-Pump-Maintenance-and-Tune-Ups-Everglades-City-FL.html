Research study recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may present threats, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year.
