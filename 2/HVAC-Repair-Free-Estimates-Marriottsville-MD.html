Not just was the price fantastic but Mark went out of his way to personalize a couple of things in my home to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I think it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I believe any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
