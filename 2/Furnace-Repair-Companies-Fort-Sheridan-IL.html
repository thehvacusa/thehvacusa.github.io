As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is activated, and the ac system has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioner's power consumption will increase by 50 W to make up for this, hence making the 100 W heating aspect cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
