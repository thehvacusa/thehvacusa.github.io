<h3>Ways To Get the Most out of Your HVAC System in Shady Dale GA</h3>
<p>Sometimes, heating repairs are simply not possible. Perhaps your furnace is too old, your heatpump is too damaged, or your boiler simply can't be fixed. Whatever the case, certain instances call for full-blown heating replacement. At Horizon Services, we have actually been helping property owners throughout Delaware, Southern New Jersey, Southeastern Pennsylvania, and Northeastern Maryland change their homes' heating unit when their old ones are no longer functional.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
