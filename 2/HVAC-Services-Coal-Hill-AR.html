<p>Weatherization generally does not trigger indoor air issues by including brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes discharge toxins.) However, measures such as installing storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the quantity of outside air penetrating into a house. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working during times of high humidity, when there is not much dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for home occupants. Unlike other kinds of a/c unit, evaporative coolers depend on the outdoors air to be directed through cooler pads that cool the air before it reaches the inside of a house through its duct system; this cooled outside air should be permitted to push the warmer air within your home out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically basic to understand and maintain.<p>
