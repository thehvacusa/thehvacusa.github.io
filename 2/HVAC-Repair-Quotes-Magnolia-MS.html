Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<h3>Heat Pump Water Heater in Magnolia MS</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have actually become aware of the $5000 rule but got ta give whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one inside your home and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply crazy and all over the place and I think they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
