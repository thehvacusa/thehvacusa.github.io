<p>Today, millions of dust mites, dead skin cells, construction debris, and mold may be living in your home's air ducts, affecting the air you breathe in addition to the effectiveness of your heating and a/c system. Indoor air quality isn't on many people's radar. Just 9 percent of Americans consider it a threat to their health, and 70 percent aren't worried about it at all, according to a current survey by the Customer Reports National Research Center.

Setting up a brand-new geothermal heat pump to work with an existing ground loop is far less expensive.<p>
