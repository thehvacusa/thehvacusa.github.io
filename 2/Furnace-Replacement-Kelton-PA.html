<h3>Water Heater and HVAC System Maintenance at Kelton PA</h3>
<p>Your lungs are responsible for bringing fresh air into your body, while all at once eliminating waste gases and particulates. Needless to state, the more particles that are in the air you breathe, the more difficult it is for your lungs to eliminate them. Poor air quality - whether it is inside or outdoors - can make it increasingly hard for your lungs to operate correctly, and can have negative health affects.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and educated. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
