Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to ensure they were no concerns other than the blower motor. The only factor he might not set up the new blower motor was due to the fact that there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the concern is.<p>
