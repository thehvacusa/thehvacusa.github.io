<p>Heating is the largest energy expenditure in the typical house. In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, often described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during hot weather.

The temperature of the inbound air is reduced, but it is likewise more humid, so the total heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is the same. Some of the reasonable heat of the entering air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The outcomes can be rather significant if the entering air is dry enough.<p>
