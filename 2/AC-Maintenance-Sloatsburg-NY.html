<p>The guidelines that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable finishing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the brand-new circuit breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We recommend you do the exact same. Once the electrical wiring is total, energize the system for a couple of minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable heats up. Do not put the system into complete operation until the thin-set and grout have had time to effectively solidify and cure-- generally two to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm bathroom floor.<p>
