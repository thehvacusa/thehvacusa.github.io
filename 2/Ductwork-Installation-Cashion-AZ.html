When the circuitry is complete, stimulate the system for a few minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable warms. Don't put the system into full operation till the thin-set and grout have actually had time to appropriately harden and treat-- typically 2 to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm bathroom floor.<p>
