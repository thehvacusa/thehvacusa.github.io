<p>Lots of indoor air toxins come from the kitchen. Gas stoves release hazardous contaminants, including carbon monoxide gas and nitrogen dioxide. Even electric burners produce those exact same contaminants in lower levels, in addition to other particles that can be easily taken in into your bloodstream. So, when you're cooking, be sure to switch on your cooking area vents, or open a window to help filter out the air even more.<p>
<p>Reinstall the access panel and disconnect block. Switch on the breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature and wait on the AC to begin (see Be Client at Startup," below). The compressor should run and the condenser fan need to spin. If the compressor starts but the fan does not, the fan motor is most likely shot. Turn off the power and eliminate the screws around the condenser cover. Raise the cover and get rid of the fan blade and motor (Picture 7). Re-install the blade and secure the cover. Then see and repower the system if the fan starts. , if it doesn't, you have actually offered it your best shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>
