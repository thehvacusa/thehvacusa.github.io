<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't rewarding you would not provide them.. Secondly like prolonged vehicle guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the required abilities to do the task and also the morals to treat customers fairly. As a customer you need to be well informed in order not to be totally taken advantage of. Most companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to properly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Finally discovered someone to appropriately service and the system has been operating issue totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

<p>Wow - simply wow. I never ever have actually become aware of the $5000 rule however got ta offer whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one indoors and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply crazy and all over the location and I think they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
