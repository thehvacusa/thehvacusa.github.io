Failure to replace these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, reduced devices life, and greater energy expenses; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air flow. Furthermore, extremely dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>
