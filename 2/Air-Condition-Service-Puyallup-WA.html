<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Individuals working in structures with bad IAQ might notice moldy or undesirable smells or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about symptoms that occur at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more major problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ problems. Talk to your medical professional about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting even worse. However not all exposures cause signs, so there is no substitute for good building management.<p>
<p>Strained Systems Overheat - When your system is unclean, and filters are plugged, and perhaps refrigerant is low, it will not be working at optimal effectiveness and might get too hot. This makes they HVAC system work harder, developing a cycle that doesn't end. An overworked system will also trigger your energy bills to rise. It's possible that the size of AC unit you have is not big enough for your house. If the system is too little, it will need to work harder and may get too hot. Typically, an HVAC system costs $4,820 to $9,350 to set up a 5-ton unit for a 2,000- to 3,000-square-foot house.<p>
