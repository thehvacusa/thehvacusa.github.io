<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor workplace, class or lab environments, rather than outdoor or industrial settings. In tasks where union subscription is not an issue, an HVAC technician might complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This includes cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, attaching the ducts to the HVAC unit, and installing the ductwork in the building. It may also consist of the installation of registers where the ductwork links to specific areas.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality designs, particularly the CONTAM series which anticipates air flows and pollutant concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic user interface that enables the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and employ "icons" to represent air flow courses, ventilation system components, and contaminant sources. CONTAM has actually been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transportation in big residential, office, and school buildings.<p>
