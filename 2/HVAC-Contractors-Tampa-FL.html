Many times, these systems contain not just the air conditioning system itself but likewise a furnace. An advantage of this system is certainly the cost. Packaged systems are excellent for those wanting to conserve cash on the installation of a brand-new heating & cooling system independently, because the unit is combined. However, one con is that these units are generally only readily available for bigger homes due to their high power and capacity.
