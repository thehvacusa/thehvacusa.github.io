<p>Your Review This is my third time using All the time. Ilan always makes himself readily available - whether it's a heating concern in the middle of the night in the depth of winter to more routine calls like a malfunctioning Nest thermostat (he is knowledgeable with these gadgets). I have nothing but terrific things to say - he has actually taken good care of my heating and AC requirements. Quick action - quick resolution.<p>
<p>Regardless of the kind of electric glowing floor heater, all are factory-built to stay in one piece and not cut, broken or altered. Any disturbance or interruption in the circulation of electrical power makes the system inoperable. This is one of the drawbacks to installing an electric convected heat system. However, assuming they are installed properly and properly taken care of, the possibility of them having problems is little.<p>
