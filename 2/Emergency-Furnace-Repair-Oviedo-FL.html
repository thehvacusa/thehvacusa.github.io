<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units use capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power readily available to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to switch on. Gradually, capacitors can wear, and when they do, you'll observe the motor running hotter. Before that occurs, you wish to get those capacitors altered to avoid further damage to your system.<p>
<p>Generally the most effective method to improve indoor air quality is to remove specific sources of contamination or to lower their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas stoves, can be gotten used to reduce the quantity of emissions. Oftentimes, source control is also a more cost-effective approach to securing indoor air quality than increasing ventilation because increasing ventilation can increase energy expenses. Particular sources of indoor air contamination in your house are listed later on in this area.<p>
