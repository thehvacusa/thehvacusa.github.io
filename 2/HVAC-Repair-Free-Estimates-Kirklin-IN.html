<h3>Commercial HVAC Contractors in Kirklin IN</h3>
<p>The federal government advises that houses be weatherized in order to lower the amount of energy needed for cooling and heating. While weatherization is underway, nevertheless, actions need to also be required to minimize pollution from sources inside the home. (See "Improving the Air Quality in Your Home" for suggested actions.) In addition, homeowners should look out to the development of signs of insufficient ventilation, such as stuffy air, moisture condensation on cold surfaces, or mold and mildew growth. Extra weatherization procedures need to not be undertaken till these issues have been corrected.<p>
<p>This is especially significant, as gas stoves can trigger levels of pollution that would be illegal outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with inadequately adjusted gas stoves can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
<p>Normally the most reliable way to improve indoor air quality is to eliminate private sources of contamination or to reduce their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas ranges, can be gotten used to decrease the quantity of emissions. In a lot of cases, source control is likewise a more affordable method to protecting indoor air quality than increasing ventilation because increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Particular sources of indoor air pollution in your home are listed later in this area.<p>
