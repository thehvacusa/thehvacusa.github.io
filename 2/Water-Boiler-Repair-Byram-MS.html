He was at my house within the time he provided me, repaired the issue while explaining the problem then remained several minutes to make sure it was working properly. The concern was repaired in a matter of time that I've never ever seen before while being a house owner for ten years. I also recommend one of the Protection Plans, which I belong to, if you like to conserve money. Thank you." Karen P.<p>
