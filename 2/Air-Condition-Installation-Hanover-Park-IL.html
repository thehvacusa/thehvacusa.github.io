<p>The primary reason property owners do not buy an HVAC service contract is the cost. They can cost in between $150 and $500 per year, depending upon the quantity of services used. The cost might not be worthwhile if the system is brand-new and still under a producer's service warranty. Any major repairs must be covered under the manufacturer's guarantee.

<p>A packaged unit, normally set up on the roof, is most commonly used on commercial buildings, however it is likewise an alternative for property owners to think about.
