<p>Recent Evaluation: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and well-informed. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
