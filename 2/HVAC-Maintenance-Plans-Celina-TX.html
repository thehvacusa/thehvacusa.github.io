<p>Proper ventilation helps improve indoor air quality. Goettl is a growing HVAC contractor with an older name. The company began in Phoenix in 1939 and produced air conditioners for high-temperature clients for decades, up until the mandate for high-efficiency systems forced Goettl to end production.

Goodrich's daddy was a Goettl dealer in Las Vegas, so when the chance came to buy what was left of the firm in 2013, he took it.<p>

<p>Using a range hood with a fan vented to the outdoors considerably reduces direct exposure to pollutants during cooking.

When the fireplace is in use, always make particular the flue in your gas fireplace is open.<p>
