<p>When installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external system to the internal ones, the main problem. While setting up a different split system, employees try to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system produces more troubles, because a few of indoor units can be located far from the exterior. The first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the air conditioning separately for each space. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a broad selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional qualities of indoor units run independently from each other.<p>

<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Just take a photo of the wires before disconnecting anything (you might require a referral later). Then discharge the saved energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters should snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. Remove the port and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you've switched all the wires, protect the new capacitor (Picture 5).<p>
