<p>An indoor air pollutant is a substance in the air that may affect the health of people who reside in the home. Contaminants might originate from outside the home-- such as an idling vehicle engine in an attached garage, backyard trash burning, or radon getting in your house from the ground below. An air pollutant might also come from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide from a malfunctioning furnace, unpredictable natural substances (VOCs) from a freshly painted room, pre-owned smoke, mold growing on wet or wet carpets, or chemicals from hobbies, home cleaning, or personal care products. Bacteria and infections, pet dander, and pest parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air pollutants.<p>
<p>While pollutants typically discovered in indoor air are accountable for many harmful impacts, there is significant uncertainty about what concentrations or periods of exposure are needed to produce specific illness. Individuals also react very differently to direct exposure to indoor air contaminants. More research is needed to better understand which health results happen after exposure to the average toxin concentrations discovered in houses and which take place from the higher concentrations that occur for brief periods of time.<p>
