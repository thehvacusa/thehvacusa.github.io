<p>Current Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
