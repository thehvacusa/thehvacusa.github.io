<p>Your air, ventilation, and heating conditioning system (HVAC) function as a collection source for a variety of impurities that have the possible to negatively impact your health-- pollutants such as mold, fungis, bacteria, and very little particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor must evaluate and, if necessary, update the structure envelope. For example, he might seal gaps and fractures in the external walls and attic flooring, or he may blow insulation into the walls, either of which might knock as much as 30% off your cooling and heating costs. Insulation might be a more reliable service to your cooling problems than replacing your equipment.<p>
<p>If you operate in construction, demolition, painting, with batteries, in a radiator service center or lead factory, or your hobby involves lead, you may unknowingly bring lead into your house on your hands or clothes.

Soil by highways and roads may be polluted from years of exhaust fumes from vehicles and trucks that used leaded gas. Use door mats to clean your feet prior to getting in the home. Alter your clothes before you go home and wash these clothes separately if you work with lead in your task or a pastime. Encourage your children to play in sand and grassy areas instead of dirt which stays with fingers and toys. Try to keep your children from eating dirt, and make sure they clean their hands when they come inside.<p>
