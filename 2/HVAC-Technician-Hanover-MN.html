<h3>Boiler Maintenance in Hanover MN - Reasons Why You Would Have to Reset The Boiler</h3>
<p>The icing issue ends up being much more extreme with lower outside temperatures, so heatpump are commonly installed in tandem with a more standard form of heating, such as an electrical heating system, a natural gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is utilized instead of the heatpump during harsher winter temperature levels. In this case, the heatpump is utilized effectively throughout the milder temperatures, and the system is changed to the standard heat source when the outside temperature level is lower.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
