<p>Air pollutants can range from impurities generated from the outdoors by your animals to unsafe gas leakages. Carbon monoxide is a common air toxin arising from gas that gets away into your house without being burned off. Older houses might consist of asbestos and lead particles, which can be damaging to the lungs when released into the air. In bathrooms and cooking areas, mold and mildew can become a nuisance where moisture levels are usually greater than in the rest of your home.<p>
<p>Sometimes a momentary indoor air quality problem is developed simply by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity happening inside a room or building, such as an overcrowded conference location. In those cases, a short-term repair might be all that's required, such as bringing or opening a window in a fan. However more complex issues-- identified by consistently unacceptable air quality tracking results-- will need a different tack. Depending on the issue you're experiencing, among the three tactics listed below might be suitable.<p>
