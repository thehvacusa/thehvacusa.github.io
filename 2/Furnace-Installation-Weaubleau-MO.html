Cool operation and very good cooling system. Yes, I was not happy with its appearances in the beginning. However then understood Air conditioners are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>

If numerous signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed, the decreased airflow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. Deice the A-coil if you have actually changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or until there's great air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've resolved the problem.<p>

If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
