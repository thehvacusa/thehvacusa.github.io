<p>The function of many structure ventilation systems is to bring in adequate fresh air for occupant comfort while controlling temperature, humidity, and indoor air quality for workers and building security at reasonable energy expenses. Load determining is described as the Handbook J estimation and must be performed by the HVAC contractor before offering an installation or unit cost for a/c. If your contractor says they know the size of air conditioning system you require based on experience or on square video alone, move to another contractor. Similar to measuring the size of a system needed based upon BTUs, figuring out the correct size of system for your house also depends upon the unit load-- just how much cold air it will lose by space.<p>

<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Just today I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the very same day. He knew simply what the problem was and repaired it really quickly. However here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my entire cooling and gas heat went totally dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>
