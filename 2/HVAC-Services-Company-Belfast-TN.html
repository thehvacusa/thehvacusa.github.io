DIY repair is possible, but the new control board need to be set up exactly right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the issue isnâ $ t correctly identified, altering a board wonâ $ t repair it, and boards are not returnable when set up. Itâ $ s smart to leave this repair to a professional to diagnose.<p>
