<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
