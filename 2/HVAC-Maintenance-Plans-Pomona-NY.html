<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil change' type of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'might' cause a problem in the future. So he said I might swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the very same cost (it never broke).<p>

Convection is the procedure of heating air and blowing it about the rooms for the warm air to keep the ceilings, floorings and walls heated. In turn, the things in the space, like furniture and individuals, would stay warm by virtue of the air temperature level.<p>
