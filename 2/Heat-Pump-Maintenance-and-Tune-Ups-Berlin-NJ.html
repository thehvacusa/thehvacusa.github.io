<p>Filters can get filthy quickly, especially if you reside in an area that can be dirty. The HVAC system filters trap all sort of dust, particles, germs, and tidy the air. They're responsible for keeping the indoor air quality. If they're not cleaned up and replaced regularly, your HVAC system will ultimately stop performing as you anticipate it to.

<p>As soon as the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high sufficient temperature, a blower fan will begin to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger allows air to be warmed without coming in contact with the real flame or burner area. Once it reaches an enough temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the home's duct, supplying warm air to specific bedrooms, living rooms and kitchens through the vents or signs up.<p>
