<p>When our furnace was passing away, we called two local companies for quotes. While both were informative and helpful, Ballard Gas gave us a much better offer, for remarkable service. Rather than an easy sales task, the owner of the company made a complete evaluation of our heating unit and located methods we could have more even heat. He consisted of these small but substantial modifications in his quote. We decided to alter from a gas furnace to an electric heatpump because of recent warmer summers and for ecological reasons.<p>

Long time Seattle homeowners are finally giving in, he says, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit homes with air-cooling systems.<p>
<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Just take a photo of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you may require a referral later on). Then discharge the stored energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp connectors ought to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you've swapped all the wires, protect the new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>
