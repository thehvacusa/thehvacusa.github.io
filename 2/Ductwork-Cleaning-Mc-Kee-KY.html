Permeable materials, wall, floor, and ceiling coverings, and furnishings found in the basements that have been wet for over 24 to 2 days may end up being a source for mold growth and should be discarded. Often there is a moldy smell however mold can not be seen. Mold does not need light to grow and can flourish in concealed or rarely accessed areas of your house, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a variety of surfaces: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on flooring products consisting of carpet underpadding. Possibilities are there will be mold growing nearby if a source of water or condensation can be discovered. Fix the moisture issue, either by locating the leakage or water source or by dehumidifying the area. Completely clean the location utilizing recognized health department suggestions.<p>
