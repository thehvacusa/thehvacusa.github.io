Permeable materials, floor, wall, and ceiling coverings, and furnishings discovered in the basements that have been wet for over 24 to two days might become a source for mold growth and must be disposed of. Sometimes there is a musty odor but mold can not be seen. Mold does not need light to grow and can thrive in surprise or rarely accessed areas of your house, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a variety of surfaces: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on flooring materials consisting of carpet underpadding. Chances are there will be mold growing nearby if a source of water or condensation can be discovered. Fix the moisture issue, either by locating the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Thoroughly tidy the area using recognized health department recommendations.<p>
