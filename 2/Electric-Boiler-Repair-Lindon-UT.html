It takes really little time to heat up or cool off your house which is one of the important things we didnâ $ t obtain from the one we had previously.

<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is normally a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
