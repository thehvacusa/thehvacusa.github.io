From one of the most basic, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the bigger, 4-inch media filter often in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more sophisticated electronic air cleaners and air purifiers, all require some basic maintenance.

<p>Current Review: They were fantastic! So many HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to supply you with the service initially requested. They met my needs entirely by offering a professional quote with options, without pushing additional products. The team appeared on time, kept me informed as they worked, and finished a little early. The also quickly followed up with the needed inspections from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly recommend this company.<p>
<p>Examples of non-friable asbestos items include vinyl asbestos floor tiles, acoustic ceiling tiles, and asbestos cement products. These items present a threat just when they are dealt with in a manner that produces dust consisting of asbestos fibers which can be inhaled. When asbestos-containing materials are harmed or disturbed by repair, redesigning, or demolition activities, tiny fibers can become airborne if appropriate controls are not in place. This can lead to the potential for substantial health issue.<p>
