<p>HVAC is a vital part of residential structures such as single family houses, apartment, hotels and senior living facilities, medium to large industrial and office buildings such as medical facilities and skyscrapers, lorries such as vehicles, trains, airplanes, ships and submarines, and in marine environments, where safe and healthy building conditions are regulated with respect to temperature and humidity, using fresh air from outdoors.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to evaporate, thus the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it takes in heat from the within air, returns to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. At the same time, heat is taken in from indoors and moved outdoors, resulting in cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>In some cases a short-term indoor air quality problem is created merely by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity occurring inside a room or structure, such as an overcrowded conference location. In those cases, a short-term repair may be all that's needed, such as bringing or opening a window in a fan. But more intricate issues-- recognized by consistently undesirable air quality tracking results-- will require a various tack. Depending on the issue you're experiencing, among the 3 methods below might be suitable.<p>
