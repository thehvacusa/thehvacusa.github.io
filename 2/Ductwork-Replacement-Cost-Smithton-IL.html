<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>How environment modification affects air quality and direct exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature level (which is a standard modus operandi for modern a/c unit) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the a/c increase. This increase has the result that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning unit eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c should increase its power intake by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of performance) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is activated, and the ac system has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioner's power intake will increase by 50 W to make up for this, therefore making the 100 W heating component cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
