<p>I generally do not leave evaluations but wished to share my experience. You don't prepare for needing to replace your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other option. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my options. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and discuss options. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will recommend this company to my good friends.<p>
