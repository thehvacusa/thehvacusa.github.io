<p>Air toxins can vary from pollutants brought in from the outdoors by your pets to hazardous gas leaks. Carbon monoxide is a typical air pollutant resulting from natural gas that gets away into your house without being burned off. Older homes may consist of asbestos and lead particles, which can be damaging to the lungs when launched into the air. In restrooms and kitchens, mold and mildew can end up being a nuisance where moisture levels are usually higher than in the rest of your home.<p>
<p>Biological pollutants include germs, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these contaminants. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are transmitted by people and animals; bacteria are brought by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and household pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a powerful allergen. When it dries, it can become air-borne. Infected central air handling systems can become reproducing grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then distribute these impurities through the home.<p>
