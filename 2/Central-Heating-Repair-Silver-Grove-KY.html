On those days when you simply can't seem to warm up and discover you require to turn up your thermostat, your furnace can suck all the humidity out of your house and leave your sinuses pulsating. In-floor heating systems are not vulnerable to this problem because they heat surfaces and not the air itself.

The outcome is a space that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature indicates. In truth, the space can feel clammy and wet.<p>
