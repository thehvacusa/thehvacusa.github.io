<p>RMI is working to alter that, starting in California. As an initial step, in April RMI testified before the California Air Resources Board, asking the company to set more powerful indoor standards based on the most recent science for NO2.

<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you need to watch out for. First, you need to check your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, but ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively if entirely iced over.<p>
