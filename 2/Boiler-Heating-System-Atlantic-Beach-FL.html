<p>Structures are developed or planned to respond actively to some of these changes in and around them with heating, cooling, aerating, air cleaning or illuminating systems. We clean, sterilize, and keep surfaces to enhance their performance, appearance, or durability. In other cases, such modifications discreetly and even significantly change structures in ways that may be important to their own integrity or their effect on structure occupants through the advancement of the physical, chemical, and biological processes that define them at any time. We may find it useful to integrate the tools of the physical sciences with those of the life sciences and, especially, some of the methods utilized by researchers studying environments, in order to get a boosted understanding of the environments in which we invest the majority of our time, our structures.<p>

<p>Individuals operating in buildings with bad IAQ might discover undesirable or musty smells or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about symptoms that happen at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more serious issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ problems. If you have signs that are not going away or are getting worse, speak with your physician about them. However not all exposures trigger signs, so there is no replacement for excellent building management.<p>
