<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing.

Initially, you must check your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis.

If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
