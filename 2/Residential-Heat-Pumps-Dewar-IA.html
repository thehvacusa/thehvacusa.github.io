<p>If you believe a mold problem-- either because of noticeable development or a moldy odor consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and preserve. Leaking return ducts can also present moisture. Again, if you think a mold issue, think about having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>

Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded right now, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 trips to collaborate their work with a company that was working on the outdoor patio where the system sits.
