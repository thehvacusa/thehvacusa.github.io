Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Photo 2). The minimized airflow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if several signs up were closed or the filter was blocked. If you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the registers, deice the A-coil.
