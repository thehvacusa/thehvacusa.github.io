<p>A packaged system, typically installed on the roofing system, is most commonly used on commercial structures, but it is also a choice for property owners to consider. Oftentimes, these units contain not only the air conditioning system itself but likewise a furnace. A benefit of this unit is certainly the cost. Packaged systems are terrific for those seeking to conserve money on the installation of a new heating & cooling system separately, given that the system is combined. Nevertheless, one con is that these systems are typically just available for bigger houses due to their high power and capability. Furthermore, while they can be a good way to save money on a total HVAC system, they're still substantially more costly than buying just a cooling system. Therefore, this might not be the very best option for property owners looking for short-term cost savings or those with smaller spending plans.<p>
