<p>A lot of well and city water does not generally include lead. Water typically gets lead inside the home from family plumbing that is made with lead materials. If there is lead in drinking water is to have it checked, the only method to understand. Contact the local health department or the water supplier to find out how to get the water evaluated. Send out for the EPA pamphlet, Lead and Your Drinking Water, to learn more about what you can do if you have actually lead in your drinking water. Call EPA's Safe Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) for more details.<p>
<p>There is no simple response, however lots of use the rule of thumb that if a repair amounts to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, changing is probably a better option. If the existing system has not sustained other major repairs, remains in otherwise outstanding condition, and concerns that led to the breakdown can be identified and treated, repairing the system can make a lot of sense too.<p>
<p>The primary health effect related to exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might pose threats, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. Your threat of lung cancer is especially high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>
