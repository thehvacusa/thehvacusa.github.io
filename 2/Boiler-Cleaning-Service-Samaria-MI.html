<p>Expert heater setups. However, even the best-maintained heater will ultimately fail. HVAC experts suggest following this standard rule when deciding whether it deserves investing in a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost majority the rate of a brand-new system, it's finest to buy brand-new. At the 15-year mark, it may be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system won't have many more years left in it, and it's most likely to be utilizing more energy than necessary.<p>
<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned up regularly, they can end up being blocked with particles that can restrict airflow, potentially impacting your comfort and your system's performance.

As a preventative measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, normally mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
