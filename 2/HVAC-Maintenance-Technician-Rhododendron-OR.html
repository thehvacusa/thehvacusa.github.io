<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
