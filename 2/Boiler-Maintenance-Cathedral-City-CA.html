<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these three things first. Ensure all the registers in your home are wide open. Then make certain the furnace filter is clean Then go outdoors and tidy off the condenser coils (Photo 2). The lowered airflow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if numerous signs up were closed or the filter was clogged. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or till there's good air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. You've solved the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
