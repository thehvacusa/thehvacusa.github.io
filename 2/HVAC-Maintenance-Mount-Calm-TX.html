<p>Recent Evaluation: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was polite and well-informed. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
