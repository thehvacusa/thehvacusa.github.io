<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Noise because 1978. The choice of indoor systems has one limitation: their total power needs to not go beyond the capacity of the outdoor system. In practice, however, it is extremely typical to see a multi-split system with an overall capacity of indoor systems higher than the outside capability by at least 20%. Nevertheless, it is wrong to expect better performance when all indoor systems are turned on at the same time, because the total capability of the whole system is limited by the capacity of the outside unit. Basically, the outside system will distribute all its power to all operating indoor systems in such a way that some of the rooms may not have an extremely comfy temperature level. However, the computation of the total power is not basic, because it takes into consideration not just the nominal power of the systems, but also the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
