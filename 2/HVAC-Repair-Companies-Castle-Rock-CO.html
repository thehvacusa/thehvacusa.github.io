<p>Right now, millions of allergen, dead skin cells, construction debris, and mold might be living in your house's duct, impacting the air you breathe as well as the performance of your heating and air conditioning system. Indoor air quality isn't on many people's radar. Just 9 percent of Americans consider it a risk to their health, and 70 percent aren't concerned about it at all, according to a current survey by the Consumer Reports National Research Center. But much of the important things people do-- or don't do-- can contribute to the stew of air-borne impurities in their homes and worsen asthma, allergic reactions, and other health conditions.<p>
<p>Whether you have central air, a ductless system, or a heatpump, whatever needs to be changed eventually. As devices ages, it becomes less efficient.

When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems actually eliminate millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have been evaporated in cooling towers in standard systems.<p>
<p>To be truthful, few of the centers supervisors who use our indoor air quality monitoring service pertained to us for that reason. More often than not they were at first thinking about remotely monitoring some other aspect of their buildings, such as energy usage, in an effort to cut costs. It wasn't until later on, as they continued dealing with us, that they learned about and implemented indoor air quality monitoring to supply a healthier, much safer building environment-- and to avoid the negative consequences connected with indoor air pollutants.<p>
