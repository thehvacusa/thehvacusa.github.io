<p>Central air conditioning systems are measured in lots. This measurement is based on the unit's ability to cool your home. For example, a 1 ton system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in heaps, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 heap unit will cool 54,000 BTUs.
