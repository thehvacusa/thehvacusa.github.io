Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a little, low-cost flexible hose pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
