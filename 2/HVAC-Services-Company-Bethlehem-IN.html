<p>There is no easy answer, however many utilize the rule of thumb that if a repair amounts to around 50% of the cost of a brand-new furnace, replacing is probably a much better solution. If the present system has not incurred other significant repairs, is in otherwise excellent condition, and issues that resulted in the breakdown can be identified and corrected, repairing the unit can make a great deal of sense too.<p>
<p>Keep an eye out for signs of water leakages or flooding to stop mold from growing. Permeable materials, ceiling, flooring, and wall coverings, and furnishings found in the basements that have been damp for over 24 to two days may end up being a source for mold growth and must be disposed of. Sometimes there is a moldy smell but mold can not be seen. Mold does not need light to grow and can thrive in covert or rarely accessed locations of your home, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a variety of surfaces: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on flooring materials consisting of carpet underpadding. Chances are there will be mold growing close by if a source of water or condensation can be found. Fix the wetness problem, either by finding the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Thoroughly tidy the area using established health department suggestions.<p>
