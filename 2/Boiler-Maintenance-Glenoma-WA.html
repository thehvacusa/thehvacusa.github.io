<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to complete. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. Once I decided to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka.

Not just was the cost fantastic but Mark headed out of his method to tailor a few things in my home to make the total air circulation more enhanced. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I believe any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>Furnaces as they age run the risk of developing fractures in the heat exchanger inside your furnace. Carbon monoxide gas, if present, could leakage into your house undetected. Indications of this may be regular headaches, a burning sensation in nose or eyes, nausea, disorientation, flu-like symptoms. Must you experience any of these, air out your home, open a window to the furnace room and instantly call a service technician. Cracks in the heat exchanger can happen undiscovered which is why nobody recommends waiting until they occur. If your household is potentially being exposed to carbon monoxide gas, the furnace needs to be changed immediately.<p>

You'll wish to have a backup system set up, such as a gas furnace, which can take over when temperatures reach freezing. If temperature levels reach and drop below freezing, your heating technician can install controls which immediately shut down the heat pump. The controls will require the furnace to come on, effectively heating the home in these conditions.<p>
