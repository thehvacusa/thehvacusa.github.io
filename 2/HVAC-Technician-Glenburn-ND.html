<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Heating is the biggest energy expenditure in the average home. In really dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature of the incoming air is lowered, however it is also more humid, so the overall heat (reasonable heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. Some of the sensible heat of the getting in air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The results can be rather substantial if the going into air is dry enough.<p>
<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head unit that installs on a wall. Due to the fact that approximately 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC unit may be lost to leakages in your ducts, a ductless system has a built-in efficiency advantage. Ductless heatpump are excellent for additions because they don't need any new ductwork to be installed. Since a system is installed in each room or location you want to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensing units that instantly raise the temperature level in the room when you are present.<p>

If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
