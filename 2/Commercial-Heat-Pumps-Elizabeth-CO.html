<p>Typically, an AC evaporator coil replacement costs $675 to $1,300. If your AC unit is frosty, the evaporator coil is most likely frozen.

Until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, however these days, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical usage and 30% lower cooling expenses than equipment set up just a few years earlier.<p>
