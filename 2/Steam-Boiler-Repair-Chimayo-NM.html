<p>Discover PSR Mechanical. The efficiency of an air cleaner depends upon how well it collects toxins from indoor air (expressed as a portion performance rate) and how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering aspect (revealed in cubic feet per minute). An extremely efficient collector with a low air-circulation rate will not be effective, nor will a cleaner with a high air-circulation rate but a less effective collector. The long-lasting efficiency of any air cleaner depends on maintaining it according to the producer's instructions.<p>

<p>The majority of central air conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air distribution system. Therefore, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to disperse cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is operating, hot air inside your home flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your house. When the air conditioner works but your house doesn't cool, the issue is most likely in the circulation system.<p>
