<p>We look at hints prior to we supply recommendations to replace instead of repair a heating system. Among the clues we look at is the cost of energy. If energy expenses are high compared to usage, or if energy expenses are higher every year, we understand the system is not running efficiently. It may be in ideal condition, but if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to change it with a more efficient model, then you would be squandering cash by not changing the older system.<p>
<p>Normally the most efficient method to enhance indoor air quality is to remove private sources of contamination or to reduce their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas stoves, can be gotten used to reduce the amount of emissions. In a lot of cases, source control is also a more cost-efficient method to protecting indoor air quality than increasing ventilation because increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Specific sources of indoor air pollution in your home are noted later in this section.<p>
