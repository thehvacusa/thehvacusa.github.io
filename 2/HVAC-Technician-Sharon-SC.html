<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>

If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outside system we'll be frozen too. Depending upon how thick the ice build-up is at your condensing system, then you'll have an excellent concept of how thick the ice build-up remains in the evaporator coil.
