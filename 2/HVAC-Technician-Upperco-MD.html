Nevertheless, pick your contractor sensibly, a lot of the 'reliable' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to improper sales methods that DO make the most of uninformed house owners. Once again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda. While Angie's list is a great base line sign that you MIGHT be dealing with a respectable company, you still need to do your research (not all contractors with a comparable score are the same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (A/c contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Have actually utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They give me priority and a lower rate when I have issues. Purchased a new main unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase extended guarantees or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Excellent financial investment in my opinion. Never ever try to offer me something I don't require.<p>
