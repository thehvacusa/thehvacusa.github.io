<p>Some cooling systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heatpump, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioning unit".

When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system also changes functions to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
