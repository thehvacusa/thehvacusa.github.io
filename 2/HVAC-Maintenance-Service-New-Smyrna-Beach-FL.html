<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sanitizing services are classified as an Important Service in Los Angeles. Today's heaters are rated 90% effectiveness or much better; it is not uncommon for a modern-day furnace to be rated 94 or 95% effective. Compared to older models, which might be ranked as low as 80% efficiency, this can suggest considerable cost savings in annual heating expenses. Modern 2- and three-stage heating systems increase efficiency even further by performing at lower or greater capability depending upon the heating requirements of the location.<p>
<p>Radiant heat covers a variety of different heating systems, consisting of electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heat systems run on comparable concepts. When it comes to a boiler, the system heats by distributing hot water through a series of pipes set up in the sub-floor of each space. In the case of electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating aspects. As the hot water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the flooring and into the space.<p>
