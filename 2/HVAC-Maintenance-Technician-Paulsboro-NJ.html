He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call business many years ago and understand the significance of having the best parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm likewise impressed that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be using Waycoff's again, and would advise them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
