According to the EPA, nevertheless, the levels of indoor air pollutants are typically 2 to 5 times greater than outside levels, and sometimes these levels can surpass 100 times that of outdoor levels of the same toxins.

<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to complete. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. Once I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the rate excellent but Mark went out of his method to personalize a couple of things in my home to make the total air circulation more optimized. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
