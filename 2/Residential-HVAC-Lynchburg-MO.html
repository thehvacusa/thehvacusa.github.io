<p>A pure maintenance agreement is not worth the paper it is written on. Every technician will inform you clean up the filters, take a tube two times a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Do not block the vents. Vacuum the registers at least one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your home.
