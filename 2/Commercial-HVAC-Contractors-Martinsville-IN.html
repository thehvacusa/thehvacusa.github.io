<p>I have been working in HVAC for over twenty years. Now I am beginning my own HVAC company. I can tell you that it is a hard task that the employees sweat and bleed at, particularly residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with consumers and keeps guys working. When a sales guy pertains to your home he is there to sell, that is the only way he is paid. You have a great Tech PM your system, he is paying bills and must not "need" to offer you something you do not need. Your $1500 UV light is something you were sold on.

<h3>Ductless Heating And Cooling in Martinsville IN</h3>
<p>Seattle heating systems can run nine months of the year. Based upon the average temperature levels in our location, if you compared running your furnace to a vehicle it would get the equivalent of 1.8 million miles over its anticipated lifespan of 15 years. Your heating unit will strive for you, but like your automobile, doing routine and routine maintenance will keep it running efficiently, prevent issues, and keep your warranty intact.<p>
<p>The likelihood of instant reactions to indoor air pollutants depends upon a number of elements. Age and preexisting medical conditions are 2 important influences. In other cases, whether an individual responds to a contaminant depends upon specific sensitivity, which differs greatly from individual to person. Some individuals can end up being sensitized to biological pollutants after repeated exposures, and it appears that some people can become sensitized to chemical pollutants also.<p>
<p>There is no easy response, but many use the guideline that if a repair amounts to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, replacing is most likely a much better service. If the current system has not sustained other significant repairs, remains in otherwise excellent condition, and issues that resulted in the breakdown can be recognized and corrected, repairing the system can make a lot of sense too.<p>
