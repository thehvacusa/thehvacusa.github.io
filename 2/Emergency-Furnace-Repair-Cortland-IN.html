<p>Lots of Canadian jurisdictions do not have particular legislation that deals with indoor air quality problems. In the absence of such legislation, the "general responsibility clause" applies. This clause, common to all Canadian occupational health and wellness legislation, specifies that a company should supply a safe and healthy  workplace. Thus, making sure the air is of excellent quality is the employer's duty.<p>
<p>When all the jobs have been completed, the last job is to test the system to ensure it cools successfully. HVAC systems are operated through the thermostat. This last check might point out faults in the thermostat, which might be as easy as a need to change batteries. A failure to turn on might simply involve a tripped breaker. At the conclusion of the service check, your HVAC technician talks about any issues or concerns and makes recommendations about upgrades where appropriate.<p>
