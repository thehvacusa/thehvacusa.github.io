<h3>Three Crucial Spring Furnace Care Tips in Clayton CA</h3>
<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil change' type of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'might' cause an issue in the future.
