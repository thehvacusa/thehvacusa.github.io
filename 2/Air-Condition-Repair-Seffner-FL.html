<h3>Furnace Service in Seffner Florida</h3>
<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" discovered something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I complained and got a refund) When this guy belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the residential or commercial property.<p>

<h3>Is The Furnace Running at Top Efficiency in Seffner FL?</h3>
<p>Integrity Energy Systems (IES) called us through the CPW program to bid on numerous house effectiveness upgrades (furnace, water heater, insulation and sealing.)

<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these 3 things initially. Make sure all the registers in the house are wide open. Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outside and clean off the condenser coils (Image 2). If a number of registers were closed or the filter was clogged, the lowered airflow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. Deice the A-coil if you have actually changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or until there's great airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. You've resolved the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
