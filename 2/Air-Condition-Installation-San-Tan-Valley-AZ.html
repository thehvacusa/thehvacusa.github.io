Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in due to the fact that the storage serves as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
<p>Ignitor and Flame Sensing Units: â $ " Â When your HSI (hot surface ignitor) or electronic lighter goes bad, the furnace canâ $ t fire, and it closes down rapidly. This is a very typical repair.
