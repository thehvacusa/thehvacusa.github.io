<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Just take a picture of the wires before disconnecting anything (you may need a referral later on). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp connectors need to snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the adapter and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Secure the new capacitor (Picture 5) when you have actually swapped all the wires.<p>
