<p>Integrity Energy Systems (IES) called us through the CPW program to bid on numerous home performance upgrades (furnace, hot water heater, insulation and sealing.) Taylor took ample time to help us dispute which upgrades were cost efficient, which upgrades we could do ourselves and what would yield us the largest cost savings.
