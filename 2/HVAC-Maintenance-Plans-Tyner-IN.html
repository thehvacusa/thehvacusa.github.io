<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, but furnace professionals typically find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Try to find a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be totally depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>

Other indoor systems install inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct handle air from the indoor system to vents or diffusers around the rooms.<p>
<p>AC air handler screeching or grinding sounds. Though the majority of air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older systems might be belt-driven. When the belt that links the motor to the blower slips, screeching noises from a belt-drive air handler typically take place.
