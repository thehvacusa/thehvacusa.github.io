<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, but furnace specialists frequently discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Try to find a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned up regularly, they can become blocked with particles that can limit air flow, possibly affecting your convenience and your system's efficiency. Dirty filters can trigger extra wear and tear on furnace components and in more severe cases cause the system to shut down entirely. By comparison, checking and replacing a furnace filter can generally be performed in simply a couple of minutes, often with no tools required. As a safety measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, make sure to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, generally mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>

<h3>The Way to Choose An Expert HVAC Technician in Peachtree Corners GA</h3>
<p>Luis was instantly responsive to email and texts with questions. He devoted to the job based just on emails, showed up and delivered with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs deal was one of the few affordable ones got. Others were nearly twice the amount Protex estimated for low end off brand devices. I got Carrier. ProTex effectively encouraged me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser although it would have made them more money (Honesty) The set up team was respectful of my home and installed the equipment in the expected quantity of time. post set up inspection outcomes look great for braising and pipes quality. New system cools far better than the 13 years of age 4 load R22 unit it changed (also Carrier).<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was polite and knowledgeable. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
