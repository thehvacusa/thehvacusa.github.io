<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>How climate change impacts air quality and exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature (which is a basic mode of operation for contemporary ac system) needs that the rate of energy elimination by the air conditioner increase. This boost has the impact that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning system eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the ac system should increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of performance) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is triggered, and the a/c has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioning system's power consumption will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, thus making the 100 W heating element cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
