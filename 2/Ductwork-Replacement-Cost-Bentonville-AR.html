<p>Heating is the largest energy expense in the average house. In really dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature level of the incoming air is lowered, however it is also more humid, so the overall heat (reasonable heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. Some of the practical heat of the entering air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The outcomes can be quite substantial if the entering air is dry enough.<p>
