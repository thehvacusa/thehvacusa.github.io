<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of liquid droplets and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, soot, and smoke. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- due to the fact that they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, produced by building and construction, for instance, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, participates in structures by means of natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>This review is for changing a 17 year old AC with a brand-new AC, humidifier, air purification system and thermostat. The technician who described our options did an exceptional job in making sure we comprehended the advantages and disadvantages of each option. The technicians who installed the new system were fast and professional, while requiring time to make sure we comprehended how the new system worked. In general a very first rate experience.<p>
