<p>Truth: Federal and local incentives usually total up to in between 30 and 60 percent of overall geothermal system cost, which can often make the initial rate of a system competitive with conventional equipment.

Geothermal HVAC systems start at about $5,000 per load, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per heap.
