<p>Truth: Federal and local incentives usually total up to in between 30 and 60 percent of overall geothermal system cost, which can often make the initial rate of a system competitive with conventional equipment. Standard air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per ton of heating or cooling capacity, throughout brand-new building and construction (houses typically utilize between one and 5 lots). Geothermal HVAC systems start at about $5,000 per load, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per heap. Nevertheless, new installation practices are reducing expenses, to the point where the price is getting closer to conventional systems under the ideal conditions.<p>
