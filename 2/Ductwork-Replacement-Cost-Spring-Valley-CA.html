<h3>Furnace Service in Spring Valley CA</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never have heard of the $5000 guideline but got ta give whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one indoors and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly and even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply insane and all over the place and I think they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>

Makers service warranty would cover the parts cost but G&S fixed and covered labor cost under their warranty. Also they identified the concern and fixed very quickly. Certainly A++ installation and service.<p>
