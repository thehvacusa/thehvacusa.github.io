<h3>HVAC Repair Cost in Reading PA</h3>
<p>Some a/c systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heatpump, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise typically described as "reverse cycle a/c". The heatpump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, in addition to the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit also changes functions to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>

<p>Since my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant got here on time. Jose spent time troubleshooting the problem, all the while describing everything to me. After finding the thermostat was not working properly. He had to go get the proper replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose discussed the operation and programing to me. I will definitely use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
