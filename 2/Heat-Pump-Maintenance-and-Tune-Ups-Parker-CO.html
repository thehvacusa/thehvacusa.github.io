<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Well-kept heating devices can last for several years. But if you're experiencing regular breakdowns or your fuel bills all of a sudden seem greater than typical, it is probably time to think about a new system.

<p>The primary problem when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones. While installing a separate split system, employees try to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little.

The very first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not allow you to set the air conditioning individually for each room. However, now the market has a large selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional qualities of indoor units operate independently from each other.<p>
