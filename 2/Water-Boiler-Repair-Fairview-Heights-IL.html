<p>The term radiant heat covers a number of different system types. Most common are boilers, which are called hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are typically referred to as simply radiant systems. Electric radiant heat systems have actually heating components set up in the subfloor of each room in the home, periodically linked to terminal units like baseboard heating systems. When the system remains in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating elements throughout your house. Heat radiates out from the heating components, through the flooring, and into the room. This is why the method is referred to as radiant heat.<p>
