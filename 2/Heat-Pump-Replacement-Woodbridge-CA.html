<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Noise given that 1978. The selection of indoor systems has one constraint: their overall power must not exceed the capability of the outdoor system. In practice, however, it is very typical to see a multi-split system with an overall capacity of indoor systems greater than the outside capacity by a minimum of 20%. Nevertheless, it is wrong to expect better efficiency when all indoor units are switched on at the very same time, given that the overall capacity of the whole system is restricted by the capacity of the outdoor system. Put simply, the outdoor system will disperse all its power to all running indoor units in such a way that some of the spaces might not have an extremely comfy temperature level. Nevertheless, the computation of the overall power is not easy, since it takes into account not just the small power of the systems, but also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
<p>When installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones, the primary problem. While setting up a different split system, workers try to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system produces more troubles, since some of indoor units can be located far from the exterior. The very first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not permit you to set the air conditioning individually for each room. However, now the market has a large selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional attributes of indoor units run independently from each other.<p>
