<h3>Ventilation System in Maytown Pennsylvania</h3>
<p>If you think a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of visible growth or a moldy smell regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it does not get rid of the mold. Mold begins with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can maintain and examine. Leaking return ducts can also introduce wetness. Once again, if you presume a mold issue, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>
