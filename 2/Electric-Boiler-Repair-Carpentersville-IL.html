In this case, the heat pump is used effectively during the milder temperatures, and the system is switched to the conventional heat source when the outdoor temperature is lower.<p>
<p>There's a big distinction between the heat transfer of radiation and the other common form of house heating-- convection. Over the past century, most of homes in cooler climates were heated up by convection, instead of radiation. Convection is the procedure of heating air and blowing it about the spaces for the warm air to keep the walls, ceilings and floorings warmed. In turn, the objects in the room, like furniture and individuals, would remain warm by virtue of the air temperature level.<p>
