<p>Trace was the service technician that looked after my semi yearly maintenance today.

He also eliminated the leaves that built up inside the interior of the compressor unit and recommended a service to prevent it from continuing, which will do.I received a detailed e-mail report of the examination outlining all the electronic measurements and service.Trace is an asset to Waychoff's and I highly advise him and Waychoff's for service and installation.<p>

<h3>Choosing the Ideal HVAC System For Your Job in Milford IL</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser unit using refrigerant piping between an indoor and outside  unit instead of ducting air straight from the outdoor system. Indoor systems with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor systems install inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct handle air from the indoor system to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was educated and respectful. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
