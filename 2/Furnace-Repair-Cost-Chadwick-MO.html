<p>To say there are a lot of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the air conditioning system back into its initial box, using the dense-foam packaging product to secure it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in the box. Set package in a cool, dry location for the winter. And if the storage room has a concrete floor, location 2 2x4s underneath the box to raise it up and secure it from moisture.<p>
<p>The primary issue when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones. While installing a different split system, workers attempt to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system develops more problems, because a few of indoor units can be situated far from the exterior. The first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the air conditioning separately for each room. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a wide choice of multi-split systems, in which the practical characteristics of indoor systems run separately from each other.<p>
