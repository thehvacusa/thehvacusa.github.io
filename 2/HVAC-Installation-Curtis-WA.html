<p>The main reason property owners do not acquire an HVAC service agreement is the cost. They can cost in between $150 and $500 annually, depending on the quantity of services used. If the system is new and still under a manufacturer's guarantee, the cost might not be worthwhile. Any major repairs need to be covered under the producer's warranty. Nevertheless, some producers require routine maintenance as a term of the warranty.<p>
<p>A packaged unit, usually installed on the roof, is most typically used on commercial structures, however it is likewise an alternative for property owners to consider. Oftentimes, these systems include not only the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this system is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged units are fantastic for those looking to conserve cash on the installation of a new heating and cooling system independently, considering that the unit is integrated. However, one con is that these systems are usually just available for bigger homes due to their high power and capacity. Furthermore, while they can be a great way to save cash on a complete HVAC system, they're still substantially more costly than purchasing just a cooling system. For that reason, this might not be the very best choice for property owners trying to find short-term cost savings or those with smaller sized budgets.<p>
