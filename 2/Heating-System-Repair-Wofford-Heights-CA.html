<p>Your full-service HVAC Repair and Installation Company. Even with routine preventive maintenance, though, there will always be the odd problem that periodically turns up. When you do discover your furnace acting oddly, it is really crucial that you call G & S Heating Cooling & Electric as quickly as possible. The faster you respond to issues with your furnace, the simpler they are to fix. Waiting to call for repairs will just make the problem even worse, and typically more expensive.<p>
<p>The term radiant heat covers a couple of various system types. Most typical are boilers, which are termed hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are often referred to as merely radiant systems. Electric radiant heating systems have heating components installed in the subfloor of each space in the house, occasionally connected to terminal units like baseboard heating systems. When the system is in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating elements throughout your house. Heat radiates out from the heating components, through the floor, and into the space. This is why the method is described as radiant heating.<p>
