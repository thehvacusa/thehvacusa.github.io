PTACs, which are often used in hotels, have two different units (terminal packages), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing unit on the exterior, with an opening going through the wall and connecting them. This lessens the interior system footprint and enables each room to be adjusted separately. PTAC systems may be adjusted to offer heating in cold weather, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the outside air, converting the a/c into a heatpump While room a/c provides optimum versatility, when utilized to cool lots of rooms at a time it is typically more pricey than central air.<p>
