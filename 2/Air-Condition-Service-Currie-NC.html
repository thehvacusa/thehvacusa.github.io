<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, however furnace professionals often find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Search for a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Examine the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>Radiant heat provides a variety of special benefits over forced air heater. For instance, radiant heat systems are more energy effective than forced air systems. They do not need to fret about duct leaks, which are responsible for output losses of as much as 30% in other heater types. Transmitting heat through solid items will also cause it to last longer than utilizing air as a thermal medium. A house heated up by a radiant system will warm up much faster, and stay warm with less energy spent. These are simply a few of the numerous benefits that a radiant heating system can use you.<p>
