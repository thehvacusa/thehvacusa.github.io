<h3>Heating Contractors in Schaumburg IL</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have heard of the $5000 rule but got ta provide whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one indoors and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just insane and all over the location and I think they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>The likelihood of instant reactions to indoor air pollutants depends on several factors. Age and preexisting medical conditions are 2 crucial influences.
