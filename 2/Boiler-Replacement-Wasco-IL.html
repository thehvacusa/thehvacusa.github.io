<h3>Recognizing the Significance of HVAC Systems at Wasco IL</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government company, carried out a research study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy costs by improving air flow. After testing 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no substantial improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy effectiveness. Sometimes, determined particle levels really increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced instantly after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>4 Seasons has installed both of my heating systems and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the annual maintenance. I have actually found them to be fairly priced, timely and do fine work. When they installed my primary furnace they worked out beyond what was necessary and redid the whole plenum and the duct for the water heater because the technicians believed they just didn't appear right and they could not leave them that method. No extra charge.<p>
