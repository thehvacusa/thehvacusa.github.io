<p>All heating systems have some level of air filtration. From one of the most standard, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the larger, 4-inch media filter often in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more sophisticated electronic air cleaners and air cleansers, all require some fundamental maintenance. These filters assist with indoor air quality by trapping air-borne pollutants streaming through your system. They can also keep your system performing well by helping reduce the buildup of dust, dirt and other particles from accumulating on internal components like the blower motor, burners and heat exchanger.<p>
<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, however lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based.

Portable instruments utilized to measure carbon dioxide should be adjusted often, and outdoor measurements utilized for computations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level effects on measurements made outdoors may also be necessary.<p>
