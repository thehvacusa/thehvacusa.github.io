<h3>Working of a HVAC System at Fultondale AL</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser system utilizing refrigerant piping in between an indoor and outside  system rather of ducting air directly from the outside system. Indoor systems with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor units mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct manage air from the indoor system to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is usually a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try once again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
