<p>Some cooling systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently referred to as "reverse cycle ac system". The heatpump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit also switches functions to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outside air).<p>
<p>EER represents Energy Performance Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air conditioning systems is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As discussed above, a BTU is a traditional unit of heat; it is specified as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The typical set conditions are outdoor temps of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why the majority of people don't utilize this measurement much any longer.<p>
