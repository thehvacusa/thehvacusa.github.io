<p>The split system is the most common. Many people are used to seeing this key in the yards of homes. With split system units, the majority of the components are housed in a metal box outside of the home. However, there are some internal components as well. Split systems are ideal for cooling numerous spaces at the same time, but are not really energy effective. Therefore, one pro is not having loud devices in the house. At the same time, the con would be that those who use this might spend more money on cooling costs in the long run because of the lower energy effectiveness.<p>
<p>Central air conditioning conditioners, typically described as central air" or split-system cooling", distribute cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and registers (i.e., openings in the floorings, walls, or ceilings covered by grills) carry cooled air from the a/c unit to the house. This cooled air ends up being warmer as it circulates through the home; then it flows back to the central air conditioning conditioner through return ducts and registers. Find out how central air conditioning conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
