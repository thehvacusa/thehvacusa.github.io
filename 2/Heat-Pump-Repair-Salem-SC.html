The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended period of consistent occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable indication of ventilation adequacy.
