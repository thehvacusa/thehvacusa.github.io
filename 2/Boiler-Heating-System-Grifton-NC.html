<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help determine the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications arise from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning takes place when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of wetness. The objective is to offer adequate changes to make sure a healthy environment. There are a number of kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to achieve this. A common element necessary in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) offers assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
