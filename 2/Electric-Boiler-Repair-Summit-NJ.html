<h3>The Way Central Heating Boilers Keep Your Summit NJ Home Toasty Warm</h3>
<p>During winter season, the ground source heat is absorbed by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid circulates around this loop, transmitting the soaked up heat to a refrigerant through the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it travels through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct result of the compression process. From here, the gas transfers to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heating unit.<p>
<p>Black Lion Heating & Cooling can deal with any type of cooling devices you have in your Seattle house. Our service technicians are highly experienced with central air units and ductless systems. It might be time to change it if your current air conditioning system is more than 15 years old and isn't working effectively. Suggestions can be offered on which system would be best for your property. We can also perform an indoor air quality evaluation to help you keep your home comfy and safe. Any of your concerns will be addressed thoroughly and not surprisingly.<p>
