<p>The Majority Of Midtown Houston Tx clients do not understand why their HVAC unit is not working when they put a 24 hr emergency ac repair request. The copper lines at the outside system we'll be frozen too if your evaporator coil is frozen. Depending upon how thick the ice build-up is at your condensing system, then you'll have an excellent concept of how thick the ice build-up is in the evaporator coil. The first thing you need to do is to examine your conditioning filters. If your filter is dirty, you remain in luck, that's more than likely your problem.

The simplest method to defrost your HVAC equipment is to leave the system off for a couple of hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is frequently in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is since ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system must temporarily change back into the routine a/c mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
