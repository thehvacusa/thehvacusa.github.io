<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound given that 1978. The selection of indoor systems has one restriction: their overall power ought to not go beyond the capability of the outside unit. In practice, however, it is really typical to see a multi-split system with an overall capacity of indoor units greater than the outside capability by at least 20%. Nevertheless, it is wrong to expect better efficiency when all indoor systems are turned on at the very same time, because the overall capability of the whole system is limited by the capability of the outdoor unit. Simply put, the outdoor unit will disperse all its power to all running indoor systems in such a method that some of the rooms may not have a really comfortable temperature level. However, the computation of the total power is not easy, since it takes into consideration not only the small power of the units, however also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>

Older systems from the 1970s might be rated 65%, indicating 35% of the heating energy is wasted during the combustion process. Today's designs range from a minimum of 78% as much as 98.5%. If your home already has ducts, changing your heating system with a new, efficient gas furnace is a fairly straightforward process. Setting up a new gas furnace system can be rather costly if you are adding on to your home or retrofitting a home without ducting.<p>

Air supply and return ducts come from inside through the home's outside wall or roofing system to get in touch with the packaged air conditioner, which is generally situated outdoors. Packaged air conditioning unit frequently consist of electric heating coils or a natural gas furnace.
