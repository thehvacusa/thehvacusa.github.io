<p>There is no simple response, but many utilize the general rule that if a repair adds up to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, replacing is probably a better service.

<p>Also, there are natural causes for indoor air pollution. For instance, human beings breathe out co2, which in small quantities is not toxic, however may become hazardous if high concentrations are enabled to accumulate. Micro-organisms or bacteria may also be present within the ventilation system. If micro-organisms do develop, they might spread throughout the whole work environment or building by ways of the ventilation system.<p>
