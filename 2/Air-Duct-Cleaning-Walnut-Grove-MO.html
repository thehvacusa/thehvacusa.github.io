<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so work with your contractor to find a place that's not near a bedroom or home-office window. Due to the fact that it exhausts warm air out the top, do not position the condenser under a deck or completely confine it. Any air flow constraint will decrease the unit's effectiveness. You can, nevertheless, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely circulate around it.<p>
<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and then determine the height and width of the opening. Make sure to have those dimensions on hand when shopping for an air conditioning system to ensure it'll fit conveniently into the window.

<p>Have actually used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They provide me priority and a lower rate when I have issues. Bought a new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever purchase prolonged warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Excellent financial investment in my viewpoint. Never ever try to offer me something I don't require.<p>
