<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil change' type of maintenance as I've checked out here).

<p>I am really amazed with this company. One of my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call organisation many years ago and know the importance of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running.

A persistent yellow-tipped flame is generally an indicator of maladjustment and increased contaminant emissions. While an area heating unit remains in use, open a door from the room where the heating unit lies to the remainder of the home and open a window somewhat.<p>
