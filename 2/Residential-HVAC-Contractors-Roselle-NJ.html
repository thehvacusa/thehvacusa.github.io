<p>During winter, the ground source heat is absorbed by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid distributes around this loop, sending the absorbed heat to a refrigerant through the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it passes through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct result of the compression process. From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heating system.<p>
<p>Indoor air quality issues are not limited to homes. In truth, numerous office buildings have significant air contamination sources A few of these structures may be improperly ventilated. For instance, mechanical ventilation systems may not be developed or operated to offer appropriate quantities of outside air.
