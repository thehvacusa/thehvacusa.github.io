<p>Proper ventilation assists improve indoor air quality. Goettl is a growing HVAC contractor with an older name. The company started in Phoenix in 1939 and produced air conditioners for high-temperature customers for decades, until the mandate for high-efficiency systems required Goettl to end production. The contracting side of the business continued under several owners. Goodrich's daddy was a Goettl dealer in Las Vegas, so when the chance pertained to buy what was left of the company in 2013, he took it.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding task locating the outside system as near to your house as possible per my demand. The job took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely well-informed of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
