<p>G&S did an excellent job installing our brand-new furnace and AC system. The best aspect of G&S is that they service warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace failed within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Makers warranty would cover the parts cost however G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their warranty. Also they detected the issue and fixed very quickly. Definitely A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>Next, and possibly simply as crucial when it pertains to central air expenses, is the AC unit's size. An unit that is too large will have an easy time keeping the house cool, however will have a more difficult time getting rid of humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too little will not have the ability to properly cool the home on hot days. Considering bigger units cost more than smaller systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC system your central air system needs to hold.<p>
<p>Watch out for signs of water leakages or flooding to stop mold from growing. Porous products, wall, ceiling, and flooring coverings, and furnishings found in the basements that have actually been wet for over 24 to two days may end up being a source for mold development and should be disposed of. Often there is a moldy smell however mold can not be seen. Mold does not need light to grow and can thrive in concealed or rarely accessed locations of your home, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a range of surface areas: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on flooring products consisting of carpet underpadding. Opportunities are there will be mold growing nearby if a source of water or condensation can be found. Fix the moisture problem, either by finding the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Completely tidy the area using recognized health department recommendations.<p>
