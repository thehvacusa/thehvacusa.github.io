Less than 24 hr after I called him, I was absolutely appreciative to have a heated house once again. What's most incredible was that this all occurred throughout Thanksgiving week!

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might believe. Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a small, economical versatile hose pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to tear and wear and is quickly pierced.<p>
