<h3>Forced Air Electric Furnace Repair and Maintenance in Florham Park NJ</h3>

<p>7 To evaluate it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the detach next to the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level below the space temperature, and then change it ON. To prevent straining an air conditioning unit's compressor, wait at least 5 minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You should hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
