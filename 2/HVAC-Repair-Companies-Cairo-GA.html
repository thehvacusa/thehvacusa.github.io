<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor workplace, class or laboratory environments, instead of outside or industrial settings. In tasks where union membership is not an issue, an HVAC technician may finish the assembly and installation of the ductwork that disperses the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This consists of cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, connecting the ducts to the HVAC unit, and installing the ductwork in the structure. It might also include the installation of registers where the ductwork links to individual spaces.<p>
<p>The most typical source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which homes are constructed. As uranium naturally breaks down, it releases radon gas which is a colorless, odor-free, radioactive gas. Radon gas goes into homes through dirt floorings, fractures in concrete walls and floors, flooring drains, and sumps. When radon ends up being caught in concentrations and structures develop indoors, exposure to radon becomes a concern.<p>
