<h3>Gas Furnace Service in Dixon CA</h3>
<p>There is a transformer in your air conditioning furnace. The transformer is what supplies 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. Your Nest will not come on if your transformer breakdowns. Your transformer transforms the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency security switches that secure your a/c system from flooding. Among the most typical areas for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety changes is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. If your Nest is revealing a blank screen, it is a likelihood; you may have a water leak in the attic. The water activates your emergency safety switch, thus cutting power to your HVAC transformer.
