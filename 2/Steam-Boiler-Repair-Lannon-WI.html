<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Central air conditioning is a luxury not everyone can pay for, numerous Seattleites need to find ways to combat the heat without a duct system. In 2015 the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in response to a heat advisory from the National Weather Service. On the other hand, in big box stores like Finest Buy, package fans and window AC systems are snatched up as soon as they're stacked in floor display screens. Seattle might be the last city in the nation to deal with the truth of a harsh, harsh summer season.<p>
