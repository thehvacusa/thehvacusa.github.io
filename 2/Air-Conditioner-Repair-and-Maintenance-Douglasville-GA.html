<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
