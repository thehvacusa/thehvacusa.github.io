<h2>How To Hire HVAC Contractors in Bennington</h2>

<p>Specialist heating system installations. Nevertheless, even the best-maintained heating system will ultimately fail. HVAC experts advise following this fundamental guideline when deciding whether it deserves buying a repair: If the system is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost over half the cost of a brand-new system, it's finest to purchase new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system won't have many more years left in it, and it's most likely to be using more energy than required.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent job locating the outdoor system as near to the house as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my lawn and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was really knowledgeable of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>Current Review: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was educated and polite. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
