This is usually used in a second or third-floor  location and benefits from the floor joist cavities while avoiding the cost, weight and extra density of an in-screed concrete pour. To make an under-timber glowing flooring heat hydronic system effective, the joist locations are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are installed under the pipelines to direct heat upward.<p>
