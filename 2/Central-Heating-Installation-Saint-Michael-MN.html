<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is simply 8 to 10 years old, it could suck up to two times the electrical power that even a low-end brand-new one would utilize. That's due to the fact that it runs at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio, which is the amount of energy required to supply a specific cooling output. Until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, however these days, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling costs than equipment set up just a few years earlier.<p>
<p>A lot of HVAC systems now have programmable thermostats that enable property owners to manage the temperature and set it on a schedule. For instance, you can set the thermostat to lower the heat when you're not in home to conserve money on the energy costs and make sure the system isn't overloaded. An expert technician will examine the thermostat throughout the annual maintenance to ensure the actual temperature level and the temperature level on the thermostat matches. If there's a distinction in the temperature, the technician needs to inspect the thermostat's performance or assess the whole HVAC system.<p>
