<p>If the hvac company didn't come out ahead they wouldn't provide contracts.  The so called credible companies swindle more people than the fly by night outfits.

PTACs, which are often utilized in hotels, have two separate units (terminal packages), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing system on the exterior, with an opening travelling through the wall and linking them. This decreases the interior system footprint and allows each room to be changed separately.
