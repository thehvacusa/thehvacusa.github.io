<p>When our furnace was passing away, we got in touch with 2 local companies for bids. While both were informative and practical, Ballard Gas offered us a better offer, for exceptional service. Rather than a simple sales task, the owner of the company made a full evaluation of our heating unit and located ways we could have more even heat. He included these small but significant adjustments in his quote. We chose to alter from a gas furnace to an electric heatpump because of recent warmer summertimes and for environmental factors.<p>
