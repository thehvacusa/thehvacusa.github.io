<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently receives requests for consultation and support in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. During the 1970s, numerous property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation measure. However, a number of these homes were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this item. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was installed several years earlier are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
