<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you would not provide them.  Secondly like extended vehicle guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the needed skills to do the job and also the morals to treat clients fairly. As a customer you need to be well informed in order not to be entirely benefited from. A lot of companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to effectively service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Finally discovered somebody to correctly service and the unit has been operating problem totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
