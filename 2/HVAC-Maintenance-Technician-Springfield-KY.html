The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'might' trigger an issue in the future. So he stated I could switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the very same cost (it never ever broke).<p>

<h3>Forced Air Furnace in Springfield KY</h3>
<p>I typically do not leave evaluations however wished to share my experience. You don't anticipate having to change your AC system. Regrettably for us, we had no other option. What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my alternatives. After organisation hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and go over options. I scheduled my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a family friend and now I will suggest this company to my pals.<p>
