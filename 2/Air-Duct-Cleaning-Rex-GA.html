<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the car debit, although my company does not provide automobile debit numerous companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of cash coming in each month, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to use vehicle debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There should not be any reason that your company can not use this. Hope this assists.<p>

<p>Indoor impurities. These consist of chemicals used in the building and construction or renovation of buildings (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning compounds). In addition, devices that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide Incomplete combustion and bad ventilation of these devices (cook ranges, gas furnaces, gas boilers, and gas water heaters) can contribute to indoor impurities. Gas cook tops need to be used with fans that send out exhaust outside.
