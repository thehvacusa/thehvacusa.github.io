<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sanitizing services are categorized as a Necessary Organisation in Los Angeles. Changed to using Wachoff's about a year earlier and they have actually been to your home for a system tune-up 3 times now. They're priced reasonably, have dealt with the one repair I needed well, and are expert and always on-time. Have actually been through a couple of companies for many years and Wachoff's is certainly the best I've had the opportunity to deal with and Jesse, my technician 2 of 3 of those times, has been excellent.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent task locating the outside unit as close to the house as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my yard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was really well-informed of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
