<p>Today, countless dust mites, dead skin cells, building debris, and mold may be living in your house's air ducts, affecting the air you breathe in addition to the efficiency of your heating and a/c system. Indoor air quality isn't on most people's radar. Only 9 percent of Americans consider it a danger to their health, and 70 percent aren't concerned about it at all, according to a current study by the Consumer Reports National Proving Ground. But a lot of the things people do-- or don't do-- can contribute to the stew of air-borne contaminants in their houses and intensify asthma, allergies, and other health conditions.<p>
<p>For example, issues develop when, in an effort to save energy, ventilation systems are not used to generate adequate amounts of outdoor air.

<h3>Things to Look for in an AC Heating Repair Service in Palo Alto CA</h3>
<p>After residing in our home for 15 years we figured itâ $ s time to change the cooling. I went on and purchased this Carrier and I need to say it does the job rather well. It takes very little time to warm up or cool down your house which is among the important things we didnâ $ t obtain from the one we had previously. The system hasnâ $ t required any repair work and Iâ $ ve had it for about half a year now.<p>
<p>Oil heating systems tend to be higher in maintenance than other types. They produce a lot of soot, which needs to be properly vented and cleaned up from the furnace routinely. Modification the filters regularly and have your ductwork cleaned because the soot builds up inside the ducts, reducing their performance in time. Expect to service your furnace annual at a cost of around $200, alter your filters every 1 - 3 months, and clean your ducts every 3 - 4 years to keep your system running optimally.<p>
