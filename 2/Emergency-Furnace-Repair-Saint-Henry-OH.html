<p>Among the primary factors a furnace will run constantly is since something is filthy or blocked Before attempting to repair any issue, require time to make certain that the thermostat settings are not at continuous fan". If the air filter is excellent to go, inspect the furnace blower for clogging and tidy it. If this does not work, take a look at the furnace blower motor and oil it. Contact a knowledgeable technician if you still can not figure out why your furnace keeps running.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is not worth the paper it is written on. Every technician will tell you clean up the filters, take a tube two times a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Do not block the vents. Vacuum the signs up at least one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your house. Now the "tough part" once a year turned off the electricity open the furnace and really thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the elements, close up the cabinet put back on the electricity. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
