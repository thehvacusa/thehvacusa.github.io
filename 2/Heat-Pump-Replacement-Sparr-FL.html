<p>It is common to assume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively steady gradually. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a structure as reasonably the same physical material with time. In fact, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and comprehended as complicated systems. Research using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
