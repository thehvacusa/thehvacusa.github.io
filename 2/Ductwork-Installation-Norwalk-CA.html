For example, a heat exchanger might stop working prematurely because the gas pressure was running to high, preparing the metal and triggering premature degeneration, resulting in holes and cracks. , if that customer had actually received a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure remains in line and protects the part.. a really advantageous outcome and one that was no charge at the time of service, but one that possibly saved a client thousands.<p>
