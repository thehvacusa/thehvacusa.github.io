<p>SysTech Design focuses on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for improving and maintaining the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment. The exact same applies for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it flows through your house. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to stay with and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils ensures dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from building up on and below the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>

Gone is that rush of hot air when the furnace kicks in which abrupt shot of coolness when it shuts off.<p>
