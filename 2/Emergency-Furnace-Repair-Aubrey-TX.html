<p>Ducted heat pump heating and cooling systems act much like traditional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces through a duct system. A ducted heatpump system might be most budget friendly if your home or building has an existing duct system that is in good shape. Utilizing existing ductwork will remove the need to install a costly new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>Regularly, indoor air quality problems in big commercial buildings can not be efficiently identified or corrected without a thorough building examination. These investigations might begin with written surveys and telephone consultations in which building investigators examine the history of occupant symptoms and building operation procedures. In some cases, these questions may quickly reveal the problem and on-site check outs are unneeded.<p>
<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Discovered both within and outside, particle matter is a mixture of solid particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, smoke, and soot. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- due to the fact that they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outside PM, produced by building and construction, for instance, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, enters into structures by means of natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
