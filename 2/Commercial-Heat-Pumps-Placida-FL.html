<p>It might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils will not provide off heat effectively and will keep the unit running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have welded together-- something that can occur gradually due to the fact that of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to inspecting the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This ought to do the trick until you purchase a replacement-- which you ought to do quickly.<p>
