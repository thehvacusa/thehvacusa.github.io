<p>Fact: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment normally lasts years, since it is protected indoors. When it does need to be changed, the cost is much less than putting in an entire new geothermal system, because the loop or well is the most costly to set up. New technical standards get rid of the issue of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some poorly sized systems did get too hot or overcool the ground in time, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature gradient to work.<p>
<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of liquid beads and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, pollen, and smoke. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- because they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, generated by building, for example, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, participates in buildings via mechanical and natural ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
