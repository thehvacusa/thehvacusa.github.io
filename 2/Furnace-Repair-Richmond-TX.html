Install a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional water heater are open, water will stream from the solar tank to the conventional hot water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the pipes getting in and the pipes leaving the traditional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar storage tank past the traditional water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer when water temperature levels are high, and the conventional hot water heater can be turned off totally.<p>

They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>
