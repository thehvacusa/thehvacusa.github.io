The item was exceptionally lite weight and takes some time to use. Note: purchase suggested non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and needed to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Make sure to see the video initially prior to installation and follow all directions specifically. , if you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.. We had problems with air bubble pockets. After calling assistance, we resolved problems. I would advise this product to anybody who's remodeling or installing their restroom for the first time.

This indicates that devices that uses R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now banned, systems that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and kept.<p>
