<p>In a typical residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar earned to his staff members, equipment expenses, marketing, utilities, and other expenditures before paying himself anything. Normally this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This doesn't sound like much, particularly if the objective of owning a service was for monetary freedom. Plus, this 6% seeks the couple of years it took to construct business and not taking an earnings as the owner. However, this 6% usually isn't the end goal.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system must briefly change back into the routine cooling mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
