I have 2 furnaces - one indoors and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just crazy and all over the location and I think they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
