<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
