<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Heating is the largest energy expenditure in the average home. In extremely dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature level of the inbound air is minimized, however it is likewise more damp, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is the same. Some of the sensible heat of the entering air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The outcomes can be quite significant if the getting in air is dry enough.<p>
<p>A SEER score means Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio.

Generally, SEER provides more information based on how the EER carries out in different temperatures.
