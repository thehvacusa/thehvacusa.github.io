<h3>Truth About Brooks KY Homeowners Must Know About Ductwork</h3>
<p>Another approach to reducing the concentrations of indoor air contaminants in your house is to increase the amount of outdoor air coming inside. The majority of house heating and cooling systems, including required air heater, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your house. Opening doors and windows, operating window or attic fans, when the weather condition allows, or running a window ac system with the vent control open boosts the outdoor ventilation rate. Local restroom or kitchen area fans that exhaust outdoors get rid of contaminants directly from the room where the fan lies and likewise increase the outside air ventilation rate.<p>

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has actually been shown to cause cancer in animals. Recent research studies show that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned items are kept and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical during the pressing and ending up processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to lessen your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible.
