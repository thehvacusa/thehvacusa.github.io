<p>There are many things to take into account when trying to determine how often I must replace my cooling filters. Every Houston Heights 77007 77008 home has an unique DNA on how it builds up dust and dirt. It takes about 6 months of close observation to see how often your a/c filter collects dirt and dust. After that, you can make a much better right choice on how often your HVAC filters require replacing. Some Houston Midtown 77003 77004 homes have more than one HVAC filter, like townhouses. The more air filters you have in your Houston Galleria 77055 77056 77057 home, the less often you'll have to clean them.

<p>The use of air filters can trap a few of the air toxins. The Department of Energy's Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy area recommends that "Air Purification must have a Minimum Performance Reporting Worth (MERV) of 13 as identified by ASHRAE 52.2-1999." citation needed Air filters are used to reduce the quantity of dust that reaches the damp coils.
