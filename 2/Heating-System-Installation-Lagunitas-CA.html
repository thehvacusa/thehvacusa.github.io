<p>The main issue when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones. While installing a different split system, employees try to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal.

The first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not permit you to set the cooling separately for each space. Nevertheless, now the market has a wide selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor units run individually from each other.<p>
