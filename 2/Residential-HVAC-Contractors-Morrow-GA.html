<p>The EPA and CMHC researchers used different methods. The CMHC research study called on a number of duct-cleaning services. The companies were not warned they became part of a research study, and the scientists did not manage for time invested or approaches utilized. The EPA research study recommended and managed methods utilized on a smaller number of homes. While the duct-cleaning industry argues both studies have defects, no other research has actually challenged the findings. And although the devices and techniques used by duct-cleaning companies have actually changed considering that these studies were carried out, the air ducts in homes haven't.<p>

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Just today I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the exact same day. He knew just what the issue was and repaired it extremely quickly. But here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my entire a/c and gas heat went completely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan had the ability to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>
