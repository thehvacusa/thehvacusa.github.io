<p>I typically do not leave evaluations but wished to share my experience. You do not expect having to change your AC system. Regrettably for us, we had no other option. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my options. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and go over alternatives. I scheduled my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family buddy and now I will recommend this company to my friends.<p>
