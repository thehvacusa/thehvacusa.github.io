<p>The majority of central air conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air distribution system. Hence, the same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the cooling system.

When the ac system works but the house does not cool, the issue is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
