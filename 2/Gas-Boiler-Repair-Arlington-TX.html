The sensible heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature level of the inbound air is lowered, however it is also more damp, so the overall heat (reasonable heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. Some of the practical heat of the getting in air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The outcomes can be quite significant if the going into air is dry enough.<p>
