<p>Cooling can also be supplied by a procedure called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, thereby declining its efficiency.<p>
