Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage serves as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
