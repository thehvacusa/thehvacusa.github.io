If numerous registers were closed or the filter was blocked, the lowered airflow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house.

Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or up until there's good airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've solved the problem.<p>
