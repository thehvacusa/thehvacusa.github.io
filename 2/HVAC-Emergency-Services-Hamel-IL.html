<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help identify the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications arise from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning takes place when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of moisture. The goal is to offer enough modifications to make sure a healthy environment. There are a number of kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be set up to achieve this.

The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) offers assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
