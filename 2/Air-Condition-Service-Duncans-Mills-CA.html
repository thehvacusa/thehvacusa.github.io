<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't successful you would not provide them.  Second of all like extended vehicle service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is really sad.

As a customer you need to be well informed in order not to be entirely benefited from. A lot of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair.
